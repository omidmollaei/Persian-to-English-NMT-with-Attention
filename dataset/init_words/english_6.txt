a rotten rainy day
during the rainy season the whole place is awash
the continuance of rainy weather
save for a rainy day
to save money for a rainy day
it is meant to be worn on rainy days
sunny side up
a sunny day
a sunny radiance
a sunny smile
on the sunny side of fifty
on the sunny side (of)
one of those sunny days that elate the heart of young and old
the north is sunny and dry
it was a bright sunny day
she was hoping for a sunny day but the fact was just the reverse
there's a picnic tomorrow, so i am praying for a sunny day
cloudy skies augur rain
a cloudy sky
how much longer will this cloudy weather hold?
tomorrow will be cold and cloudy
his ideas on this topic seemed very cloudy
this river's water has turned into a cloudy green
