It was his conviction that while cleverness is appropriate to rhetoric, and inventiveness to poetry, truth alone is appropriate to history
Such, it is evident, was the archery of the past
But the bowmen of the present time go into battle wearing corselets and fitted out with greaves which extend up to the knee
From the right side hang their arrows, from the other the sword
But no such consideration will prevent the conclusion that most great and notable deeds have been performed in these wars
For Arcadius had no hope that the boys uncle, Honorius, would succour him, inasmuch as the situation in Italy was already troublesome
So Arcadius died, having thus arranged his private affairs as well as those of the empire
This came about in the following way
And when Vararanes saw him, he enquired from those who were near who this man could be who was coming forward
And they replied that he was the general of the Romans
When this treaty had been executed, both sovereigns then continued to administer the affairs of their respective countries as seemed best to them
For they are not nomads like the other Hunnic peoples, but for a long period have been established in a goodly land
As a result of this they have never made any incursion into the Roman territory except in company with the Median army
They are the only ones among the Huns who have white bodies and countenances which are not ugly
When Perozes heard this, a fear came over him lest perchance the Medes had brought harm upon themselves by their pursuit of the enemy
He therefore advanced no further, but, remaining where he was, began to consider the situation
In this way, they explained, he would be able in the future to escape the ignominy of the deed
IV Not long after this, disregarding the oath he had sworn, he was eager to avenge himself upon the Huns for the insult done him
They thereupon retorted that he had abandoned nothing, except, forsooth, the one opportunity on which, as it turned out, everything else depended
For he insisted that as yet they had received no definite information as to the invasion, for the Persians were still within their own boundaries
So, remaining where he was, he busied himself as follows
Over the trench he placed reeds, and upon the reeds he scattered earth, thereby concealing the true surface
Among them were Perozes and all his sons
This pearl the Roman Emperor then made every effort to buy from the Ephthalitae, but was utterly unsuccessful
For the barbarians were not able to find it although they sought it with great labour
However, they say that the Ephthalitae found it later and sold it to Cabades
The story of this pearl, as told by the Persians, is worth recounting, for perhaps to some it may not seem altogether incredible
Now I intend to make trial of the monster, and hope to make thee master of the pearl
And if I succeed in this struggle, it is plain that henceforth I shall be ranked among those who are counted blessed
With these words he departed
But the men who had been left upon the beach picked up the pearl, and, conveying it to the king, reported all that had happened
Such, then, is the story which the Persians relate, just as I have set it down, concerning this pearl
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thus Perozes was destroyed and the whole Persian army with him
For the few who by chance did not fall into the ditch found themselves at the mercy of the enemy
And the time these barbarians ruled over the Persians was two years
Accordingly they rose against him, removed him from the throne, and kept him in prison in chains
This he said hinting that, if they did not put Cabades to death, he would straightway make trouble for the Persians
And by the long continuance of this war it came about that both sides suffered beyond measure, and especially the Armenians
But each nation was possessed by such great distrust of the other that neither of them could make overtures of peace to their opponents
In the meantime it happened that the Persians became engaged in a war with certain other barbarians who lived not far from the Armenians
Then they fell upon them unexpectedly and killed almost the whole population, old and young alike
And when Arsaces came to him he shewed him every kindness, and treated him as a brother on an equal footing with himself
Not long after this certain persons slandered Arsaces, saying that he was purposing to undertake some seditious enterprise
Pacurius was persuaded by these men and again summoned him, intimating that he was anxious to confer with him on general matters
They, however, denied the charge, and swore most insistently that no such thing had been considered by them
At first, therefore, Pacurius kept them under guard in disgrace, but after a time he enquired of the Magi what should be done with them
They bade him cover the floor of the royal tent with earth, one half from the land of Persia, and the other half from Armenia
This the king did as directed
They said, further, that they too must be present at the conversation, for in this way there would be witnesses of all that was said
Thereupon, as if chanting a recantation, he was once more a suppliant, offering pitiable explanations to Pacurius
But when he came again to the Armenian earth, he returned to his threats
In this way he changed many times to one side and the other, and concealed none of his secrets
Then at length the Magi passed judgment against him as having violated the treaty and the oaths
Pacurius flayed Bassicius, and, making a bag of his skin, filled it with chaff and suspended it from a lofty tree
This man proved himself a capable warrior in this campaign, as Pacurius observed, and was the chief cause of the Persian victory
For this reason Pacurius begged him to make any request he wished, assuring him that he would be refused nothing by him
The Armenian asked for nothing else than that he might for one day pay homage to Arsaces in the way he might desire
Then Arsaces entertained those present with a royal banquet just as was formerly his custom
During this feast many speeches were made over the cups which greatly pleased Arsaces, and many incidents occurred which delighted his heart
But I must return to the point from which I have strayed
Now the keeper of the prison began to make advances to her, for she was exceedingly beautiful to look upon
And when Cabades learned this from his wife, he bade her give herself over to the man to treat as he wished
In this way, therefore, Cabades made his escape from the prison
For the Persian accounts do not agree with each other, and for this reason I omit the narration of them
This army the Persians were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made haste to flee in every direction
Even as he was considering this matter, chance brought it about that, without dishonouring the law, he could still keep his word
Thereafter Blases was kept in confinement, having ruled over the Persians two years
Seoses was the first and only man who held this office in Persia for it was conferred on no one before or after that time
And the kingdom was strengthened by Cabades and guarded securely for in shrewdness and activity he was surpassed by none
It was for this reason, and for no just cause, that Cabades decided to make an expedition against the Romans
Now there was among the Syrians a certain just man, Jacobus by name, who had trained himself with exactitude in matters pertaining to religion
And they had constructed for him a small roof over his head, sufficient to keep off the rain and snow
But the hands of every one of them became motionless and utterly unable to manage the bow
And he forgave them with a word, and the men were released from their distress
But he requested Cabades to grant to him all the men who during that war should come to him as fugitives
This request Cabades granted, and gave him a written pledge of his personal safety
Thus, then, did these things take place
However, Cabades did not slacken his efforts until he realized that the wall could not be successfully assailed in this way
However, the outside kept the form which it had at first assumed, and afforded no opportunity to anyone of discovering what was being done
But with the great mass of men crowding upon it with a rush, the hill suddenly fell in and killed almost all of them
Cabades, then, finding no remedy for the situation, decided to raise the siege, and he issued orders to the army to retreat on the morrow
Then indeed the besieged, as though they had no thought of their danger, began laughingly from the fortifications to jeer at the barbarians
So the Persian army remained there
The king himself on the following night came to the spot with a few men, bringing ladders which he had made ready
These men, as chance would have it, were keeping some annual religious festival to God on that day
When Cabades learned this, he brought his ladders up to the wall close by this tower
It was already day
As a result of this the Persians by their numbers gained the upper hand and overcame their antagonists in the fight
So the city was captured by storm on the eightieth day after the beginning of the siege
But this happened in later years
VIII At that time the Emperor Anastasius, upon learning that Amida was being besieged, dispatched with all speed an army of sufficient strength
For such an army, they say, was never assembled by the Romans against the Persians either before or after that time
Now this army was mustered with considerable delay, and advanced with little speed
However they did not advance together against the barbarians but they encamped apart from one another as they proceeded
When Cabades learned this for he happened to be close by, he came with all speed to the Roman frontier and confronted them
As for Celer, he had not yet arrived
And the enemy, coming up not long afterwards, captured the camp without a man in it and all the money it contained
From there they advanced swiftly against the other Roman army
At any rate they had stacked their arms and were preparing themselves a lunch for already the appropriate time of day was drawing near
Straightway, then, they fell upon them feasting and unarmed
And they say that not a man escaped from there but Patricius and Hypatius had succeeded in getting away at the beginning of the onset
However Celer, with his contingent, crossed the Nymphius River and made some sort of an invasion into Arzanene
This river is one very close to Martyropolis, about three hundred stades from Amida
So Celers troops plundered the country thereabout and returned not long after, and the whole invasion was completed in a short time
Both parties then gladly executed the terms of the agreement, and the son of Glones, upon receiving the money, delivered over Amida to the Romans
For Glones himself had already died in the following manner
And the general promised that he should have everything he desired, and thus dismissed the fellow
He then tore his garments in a dreadful manner, and, assuming the aspect of one who had been weeping, entered the city
But do you, O Master, take thought to defend yourself and us and the Persians
For if you go hunting into the outskirts of the city, you will find rare game
For the accursed rascals go about by fours or fives to do their robbery
Thus he spoke
And Glones was persuaded, and enquired of the fellow about how many Persians he thought would be sufficient for him to carry out the enterprise
Glones accordingly picked out two hundred horsemen and bade the fellow lead the way for them
Accordingly, since he seemed to Glones to speak well, he was sent forward by his own order
Then he came before the general Patricius and explained everything and the general sent with him two of his own bodyguard and a thousand soldiers
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thus the Romans by giving the money recovered Amida two years after it had been captured by the enemy
And when they got into the city, their own negligence and the hardships under which the Persians had maintained themselves were discovered
Thus, then, as has been told, began the war of the Romans and the Persians, and to this end did it come
But I shall now turn to the narration of the events touching the Caspian Gates
This path terminates in a place cut off by cliffs and, as it seems, absolutely impossible to pass through
From there on there are plains suitable for riding and extremely well watered, and extensive tracts used as pasture land for horses, and level besides
Here almost all the nations of the Huns are settled, extending as far as the Maeotic lake
If, however, they go by any other passes, they reach their destination with great difficulty, and can no longer use the same horses
For the detours which they are forced to make are many and steep besides
When this was observed by Alexander, the son of Philip, he constructed gates in the aforesaid place and established a fortress there
So Ambazouces died of disease not long afterwards, and Cabades overpowered his sons and took possession of the Gates
And Zames, who was second in age, having had one of his eyes struck out, was prevented by the law
For it is not lawful for a oneeyed man or one having any other deformity to become king over the Persians
Accordingly he sent envoys to treat of this matter and a letter to the Emperor Justinus in Byzantium
My proposal, then, is this, that you should make my son Chosroes, who will be my successor to the throne, your adopted son
Take this first resolve if you choose if you do you must agree to all its consequences
Thus spoke Proclus and the emperor and his nephew gave ear to his words and deliberated upon what should be done
He also answered Cabades by letter to the same effect
When the Romans heard this, they were indignant to think that even Lazica should be disputed by the Persians
Now the whole Persian council gathered to sit in judgment moved more by envy than by respect for the law
For they were thoroughly hostile to his office, which was unfamiliar to them, and also were embittered by the natural temper of the man
Thus, then, Seoses was condemned and was removed from among men
And the office which began with him ended also with him
For no other man has been made adrastadaran salanes
Rufinus also slandered Hypatius to the emperor
The Iberians, who live in Asia, are settled in the immediate neighbourhood of the Caspian Gates, which lie to the north of them
Adjoining them on the left towards the west is Lazica, and on the right towards the east are the Persian peoples
And just then Cabades was desirous of forcing them to adopt the rites of his own religion
Between these cities everything is held by the Huns
Now in ancient times the people of Bosporus were autonomous, but lately they had decided to become subject to the Emperor Justinus
Meanwhile Cabades sent a very considerable army against Gourgenes and the Iberians, and as general a Persian bearing the title of varizes, Boes by name
And the Persians followed after them but did nothing deserving even of mention since the circumstance of the rough country was against them
Nor indeed can anything be carried in from elsewhere on account of the narrowness of the paths, unless it be carried by men
However, the Lazi were able to live on a certain kind of millet which grows there, since they were accustomed to it
These garrisons the emperor removed from the place and commanded that Roman soldiers should be stationed there to guard the fortresses
This then happened in Lazica
These two men were both youths and wearing their first beards, bodyguards of the general Justinian, who later shared the empire with his uncle Justinus
But when a second inroad had been made by the Romans into Armenia, Narses and Aratius unexpectedly confronted them and engaged them in battle
An invasion was also made near the city of Nisibis by another Roman army under command of Libelarius of Thrace
This army retired abruptly in flight although no one came out against thorn
And because of this the emperor reduced Libelarius from his office and appointed Belisarius commander of the troops in Daras
It was at that time that Procopius, who wrote this history, was chosen as his adviser
, Not long after this Justinus, who had declared his nephew Justinian emperor with him, died, and thus the empire came to Justinian alone
These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy
Among these was Coutzes himself
After this the Emperor Justinian appointed Belisarius General of the East and bade him make an expedition against the Persians
And he collected a very formidable army and came to Daras
The emperor also sent Rufinus as ambassador, commanding him to remain in Hierapolis on the Euphrates River until he himself should give the word
For already much was being said on both sides concerning peace
And when they heard this, they prepared for the battle as follows
Now this trench was not dug in a straight line, but in the following manner
Among the leaders of this army were Pityaxes and the oneeyed Baresmanas
But one general held command over them all, a Persian, whose title was mirranes for thus the Persians designate this office, Perozes by name
This Perozes immediately sent to Belisarius bidding him make ready the bath for he wished to bathe there on the following day
Accordingly the Romans made the most vigorous preparations for the encounter, with the expectation that they would fight on the succeeding day
At sunrise, seeing the enemy advancing against them, they arrayed themselves as follows
Thus all along the trench stood the detachments of cavalry and the infantry
And behind these in the middle stood the forces of Belisarius and Hermogenes
And the Romans retired a short distance to the rear
The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the part of the enemy
Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly rushed upon them
In this skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies thereafter both armies remained quietly in position
And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast
And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth
Thus both armies passed that night
The best general, therefore, is that one who is able to bring about peace from war
For here we shall be compelled either to die or grow old until you accord to us justice in deed
Such was the reply which the mirranes wrote back
Such was the message of this letter
But let the bath and lunch be in readiness for me within the fortifications
When Belisarius and his generals read this, they prepared themselves for the conflict
For this reason too it happened that they were not thrown into confusion, for they had not yet come into the dangers of battle
With this exhortation the mirranes began to lead his army against the enemy
This thing you now have the opportunity to set right with no trouble
If therefore you are willing to give heed to the orders given, you will straightway win for yourselves the superiority in battle
For the Persians come against us basing their confidence on nothing else than our disorder
But this time also they will be disappointed in this hope, and will depart just as in the previous encounter
And the barbarians, coming up before them, took their stand facing the Romans
But the detachment of the socalled Immortals alone he ordered to remain at rest until he himself should give the signal
And he took his own station at the middle of the front, putting Pityaxes in command on the right wing, and Baresmanas on the left
In this manner, then, both armies were drawn up
Thus he spoke, and, since it pleased Belisarius and his staff, he carried out this plan
But up to midday neither side began battle
For a steady wind blew from their side against the barbarians, and checked to a considerable degree the force of their arrows
On the Roman side the left wing was suffering especially
When this was observed by the men under Sunicas and Aigan, they charged against them at full speed
And the Persians, seeing the forces of Sunicas too already coming up against them from the flank, turned to a hasty flight
And the rout became complete, for the Romans here joined forces with each other, and there was a great slaughter of the barbarians
And the Romans did not continue their pursuit, but both sides took their stand facing each other in line
Such was the course of these events
But the mirranes stealthily sent to the left a large body of troops and with them all the socalled Immortals
Thereupon the Romans in the angle, and all who were behind them, advanced with great ardour against the pursuers
Among these happened to be the standard bearer of Baresmanas, whom Sunicas charged and struck with his spear
For those in flight before them understood what was happening and turned back again
There the Romans held their ground
And first Sunicas killed Baresmanas and threw him from his horse to the ground
As a result of this the barbarians were seized with great fear and thought no longer of resistance, but fled in utter confusion
And the Romans, having made a circle as it were around them, killed about five thousand
Thus both armies were all set in motion, the Persians in retreat, and the Romans in pursuit
However, the pursuit was not continued by the Romans over a great distance
For on that day the Persians had been defeated in battle by the Romans, a thing which had not happened for a long time
Thus the two armies separated from each other
And the Persians were no longer willing to fight a pitched battle with the Romans
However, some sudden attacks were made on both sides, in which the Romans were not at a disadvantage
Such, then, was the fortune of the armies in Mesopotamia
XV And Cabades sent another army into the part of Armenia which is subject to the Romans
This army was composed of Persarmenians and Sunitae, whose land adjoins that of the Alani
There were also Huns with them, of the stock called Sabiri, to the number of three thousand, a most warlike race
And Mermeroes, a Persian, had been made general of the whole force
Now the general of Armenia was, as it happened, Dorotheus, a man of discretion and experienced in many wars
And Sittas held the office of general in Byzantium, and had authority over the whole army in Armenia
And both of these men got into the barbarian camp, and after noting everything accurately, they departed
And they were travelling toward some place in that region, when they happened unexpectedly upon hostile Huns
Thereupon the Romans, after killing a large number and plundering the camp, immediately marched back
Not long after this Mermeroes, having collected the whole army, invaded the Roman territory, and they came upon their enemy near the city of Satala
There they established themselves in camp and remained at rest in a place called Octava, which is fiftysix stades distant from the city
On the following day the barbarians came up close to the fortifications and busily set about closing in the town
They thus put the Persians between their own troops, and turned them to flight
And both sides kept making advances upon their opponents and retiring quickly, for they were all cavalry
And though he himself was overtaken and fell there, hacked to pieces, he proved to be the chief cause of the victory for the Romans
Wherefore also the Roman emperor sent them each year a fixed amount of gold, with the condition that they should never plunder the country thereabout
They also abandoned their own religion for a more righteous faith, and all of them became Christians
Such then was the history of the Tzani
Beyond the borders of this people there is a caon whose walls are both high and exceedingly steep, extending as far as the Caucasus mountains
In it are populous towns, and grapes and other fruits grow plentifully
When this Symeon saw that both nations were actively engaged in the war, he decided to deprive Cabades of the revenue
Therefore he gave over both himself and Pharangium to the Romans, but refused to deliver over to either one the gold of the mine
Thus he too came to Byzantium
XVI Thus matters stood with the Romans
So spoke Rufinus
And even now the Romans may choose peace, or they may elect war, by either doing justice to us or going against our rights
This was reported to the emperor by Rufinus when he came to Byzantium
XVII At the opening of spring a Persian army under the leadership of Azarethes invaded the Roman territory
They were fifteen thousand strong, all horsemen
With them was Alamoundaras, son of Saccice, with a very large body of Saracens
There is a mountain in Armenia which is not especially precipitous, twoandforty stades removed from Theodosiopolis and lying toward the north from it
From this mountain issue two springs, forming immediately two rivers, the one on the right called the Euphrates, and the other the Tigris
One of these, the Tigris, descends, with no deviations and with no tributaries except small ones emptying into it, straight toward the city of Amida
And continuing into the country which lies to the north of this city it enters the land of Assyria
For the other temple which has existed even to my day in the city of Comana is not the one Among the Taurians
But I shall explain how this temple came into being
When Orestes had departed in haste from the Taurians with his sister, it so happened that he contracted some disease
The story goes on that after Orestes had done these things, the disease continued to be as violent as before, if not even more so
I myself have often seen this place and admired it exceedingly, and have imagined that I was in the land of the Taurians
For this mountain resembles the other remarkably, since the Taurus is here also and the river Sarus is similar to the Euphrates there
But I shall return to the previous narrative
The land which lies outside the River Euphrates, beginning with Samosata, was called in ancient times Commagene, but now it is named after the river
Now this is a great dignity among the Persians, second only to the kingly honour
Thereafter Cabades began to consider in what manner he himself should make an expedition against the Romans
For after the mirranes had failed in the manner I have told, he felt confidence in no one else
For those who assume the risk of an even struggle have no assurance of victory
Now, therefore, O King of Kings, neither be thus distressed by the misfortune which has befallen Mirranes, nor desire again to make trial of fortune
For this I have often heard from the Saracens sent as spies to these parts
For the people of this city care for nothing else than ftes and luxurious living, and their constant rivalries with each other in the theatres
When Cabades heard this he could neither oppose nor distrust the plan
And he was confronted by no one at all
And, in a word, this man proved himself the most difficult and dangerous enemy of all to the Romans
For as yet we know nothing certain about him
Now the Roman army amounted to about twenty thousand foot and horse, and among them not less than two thousand were Isaurians
The Isaurians, however, were under the command of Longinus and Stephanacius
Arethas also came there to join them with the Saracen army
Accordingly they began to march back, with the River Euphrates on the left, while the Roman army was following in the rear
And in the spot where the Persians bivouacked each night the Romans always tarried on the following night
And because of this all secretly mocked him, both officers and soldiers, but not a man reproached him to his face
Finally the Persians made their bivouac on the bank of the Euphrates just opposite the city of Callinicus
Therefore it is better to enjoy the benefit of our present blessings than to seek them when they have passed
For the Persians, led on by many hopes, undertook an expedition against the Romans, and now, with everything lost, they have beaten a hasty retreat
I refrain from mentioning that some even now have not arrived
So spoke Belisarius
Thus the Romans arrayed themselves
But I say that not even if you should wish, is it within your power to make the choice between the two
Straightway both sides began the fight, and the battle was exceedingly fierce
Now already twothirds of the day had passed, and the battle was still even
But they broke their formation and moved apart, so that they got the reputation of having betrayed the Romans to the Persians
For without awaiting the oncoming enemy they all straightway beat a hasty retreat
So the Persians in this way broke through the enemys line and immediately got in the rear of the Roman cavalry
They were not in fact all Isaurians but the majority of them were Lycaones
Nevertheless the enemy were not able either to rout them or in any other way to overpower them
For their horses, annoyed by the clashing of the shields, reared up and made confusion for themselves and their riders
Thus both sides continued the struggle until it had become late in the day
However they did not find their own dead less numerous than the enemys
When Azarethes reached Persia with his army, although he had prospered in the battle, he found Cabades exceedingly ungrateful, for the following reason
Thus the law has stood from of old among the Persians
And Azarethes said that he had captured no fortress, but that he had conquered the Romans and Belisarius in battle
So Cabades bade the army of Azarethes pass by, and from the baskets each man took out a weapon just as was customary
But since many weapons were left, Cabades rebuked Azarethes for the victory and thereafter ranked him among the most unworthy
So the victory had this conclusion for Azarethes
The boundaries of Palestine extend toward the east to the sea which is called the Red Sea
Now this sea, beginning at India, comes to an end at this point in the Roman domain
On this island Hebrews had lived from of old in autonomy, but in the reign of this Justinian they have become subject to the Romans
From there on there comes a great open sea
For it is impossible to navigate in the darkness on this sea, since it is everywhere full of shoals
This coast immediately beyond the boundaries of Palestine is held by Saracens, who have been settled from of old in the Palm Groves
These groves are in the interior, extending over a great tract of land, and there absolutely nothing else grows except palm trees
Formally, therefore, the emperor holds the Palm Groves, but for him really to possess himself of any of the country there is utterly impossible
So much then for the Palm Groves
Adjoining this people there are other Saracens in possession of the coast, who are called Maddeni and who are subjects of the Homeritae
These Homeritae dwell in the land on the farther side of them on the shore of the sea
And beyond them many other nations are said to be settled as far as the maneating Saracens
Beyond these are the nations of India
But regarding these matters let each one speak as he may wish
About opposite the Homeritae on the opposite mainland dwell the Aethiopians who are called Auxomitae, because their king resides in the city of Auxomis
And the expanse of sea which lies between is crossed in a voyage of five days and nights, when a moderately favouring wind blows
All the boats which are found in India and on this sea are not made in the same manner as are other ships
Such then is the description of the socalled Red Sea and of the land which lies on either side of it
Within that space many nations are settled, and among them the Blemyes and the Nobatae, who are very large nations
But the Blemyes dwell in the central portion of the country, while the Nobatae possess the territory about the River Nile
And they receive this gold even up to my time, but none the less they overrun the country there
And for this reason he named the place Philae
But the Blemyes are accustomed also to sacrifice human beings to the sun
These sanctuaries in Philae were kept by these barbarians even up to my time, but the Emperor Justinian decided to tear them down
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thereafter the king of the Aethiopians became afraid, and sent no further expeditions against Abramus
But this happened at a later time
So each king, promising to put this demand into effect, dismissed the ambassador, but neither one of them did the things agreed upon by them
Such then were the relations which the Romans had with the Aethiopians and the Homeritae
And the Persians once more invaded Mesopotamia with a great army under command of Chanaranges and Aspebedes and Mermeroes
Hermogenes also was with them, coming again as ambassador from Byzantium
At this point the following event took place
And when they heard this, they were seized with terror, and were at a loss how to deal with the situation
So Cabades set it down plainly that Chosroes should become king over the Persians
The document was written by Mebodes himself, and Cabades immediately passed from among men
So Caoses committed the decision in the matter to the magistrates, supposing that there would be no opposition to him from there
Thus then Chosroes secured the power
Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans
And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns
And when Chosroes saw them, he released the hostages
Then the ambassadors coaxed Chosroes, and spoke many beguiling words most unbecoming to Roman ambassadors
Now the centenarium weighs one hundred pounds, for which reason it is so called for the Romans call one hundred centum
It was decided, accordingly, that Rufinus should be sent concerning them to Byzantium, and that the others should wait until he should return
And it was arranged with Rufinus that seventy days time be allowed until he should arrive
In the meantime, however, a report which was not true reached Persia saying that the Emperor Justinian had become enraged and put Rufinus to death
Chosroes indeed was much perturbed by this, and, already filled with anger, he advanced against the Romans with his whole army
But Rufinus met him on the way as he was returning not far from the city of Nisibis
Therefore they proceeded to this city themselves, and, since they were about to establish the peace, the ambassadors began to convey the money thither
And Chosroes bade him rise from the ground, promising that he would grant all these things
So the ambassadors with the money came to Daras and the Persian army marched back
However, the emperor showed him no disfavour on account of this
And there were many who remained, and many also who returned to their ancestral homes
Thus, then, they concluded the socalled endless peace, when the Emperor Justinian was already in the sixth year of his reign
The Persians also returned Dagaris to the Romans, and received in return for him another man of no mean station
Thus both sides in the manner described made secure the treaty between them
XXIII Straightway it came about that plots were formed against both rulers by their subjects and I shall now explain how this happened
Chosroes, the son of Cabades, was a man of an unruly turn of mind and strangely fond of innovations
For this reason he himself was always full of excitement and alarms, and he was an unfailing cause of similar feelings in all others
So they went to Zames and disclosed their plan, and, urging him on with great enthusiasm, they endeavoured to persuade him to undertake the thing
And since the plan pleased him, they were purposing to assail Chosroes at the fitting moment
But the plan was discovered and came to the knowledge of the king, and thus their proceedings were stopped
Among these was Aspebedes, the brother of Chosroes mother
Cabades, however, the son of Zames, he was quite unable to kill for he was still being reared under the chanaranges, Adergoudounbades
Then the woman, bursting into tears and seizing the knees of her husband, entreated him by no means to kill Cabades
At that time, then, Chosroes and all the others were in ignorance of the fact that the chanaranges had carried this thing through
It was therefore necessary for him to remain there quietly and be cared for, and the king came to that place and saw him
After Adergoudounbades had been removed from the world, Varrames, his son, received the office of chanaranges
And the Emperor Justinian, though in doubt concerning him, received him with great friendliness and honoured him as the grandson of Cabades
So then fared the Persians who rose against Chosroes
Later on Chosroes destroyed also Mebodes for the following reason
While the king was arranging a certain important matter, he directed Zaberganes who was present to call Mebodes
Now it happened that Zaberganes was on hostile terms with Mebodes
Chosroes, therefore, moved with anger, sent one of his attendants commanding Mebodes to go to the tripod
Now as to what this is I shall explain forthwith
There Mebodes sat in pitiable plight for many days, until he was seized and put to death at the command of Chosroes
Such was the final outcome of his good deeds to Chosroes
This, then, is pretty well how matters stand among the people of each and every city
But at this time the officers of the city administration in Byzantium were leading away to death some of the rioters
During this time the emperor and his consort with a few members of the senate shut themselves up in the palace and remained quietly there
For he was most capable in deciding upon what was needful and in finding a solution for difficulties
Such a man then was John
Accordingly the emperor, wishing to win the people to his side, instantly dismissed both these men from office
However, the insurrection continued no less violently under them
When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he inclined still more to his suspicion, and he bade them quit the palace instantly
Thus, then, these two men betook themselves to their homes, and, as long as it was night, they remained there quietly
But on the following day at sunrise it became known to the people that both men had quit the palace where they had been staying
So the whole population ran to them, and they declared Hypatius emperor and prepared to lead him to the marketplace to assume the power
Now war and royal power are agreed to be the greatest of all things in the world
For those things whose issue is most quickly decided, fall, as a rule, under the sway of fortune
So spoke Origenes
But some say that he came there purposely, being welldisposed toward the emperor
And many opinions were expressed favouring either course
My opinion then is that the present time, above all others, is inopportune for flight, even though it bring safety
If, now, it is your wish to save yourself, O Emperor, there is no difficulty
For we have much money, and there is the sea, here the boats
However consider whether it will not come about after you have been saved that you would gladly exchange that safety for death
For as for myself, I approve a certain ancient saying that royalty is a good burialshroud
And from the palace Mundus went out through the gate which, from the circling descent, has been given the name of the Snail
The emperor therefore commanded him to go to the socalled Bronze Gate and the propylaea there
Then indeed from both sides the partisans of Hypatius were assailed with might and main and destroyed
And there perished among the populace on that day more than thirty thousand
But the emperor commanded the two prisoners to be kept in severe confinement
And the soldiers killed both of them on the following day and threw their bodies into the sea
This was the end of the insurrection in Byzantium
XXV Tribunianus and John were thus deprived of office, but at a later time they were both restored to the same positions
And Tribunianus lived on in office many years and died of disease, suffering no further harm from anyone
The Empress Theodora hated him above all others
And when John learned of the purpose of the queen regarding him, he was greatly terrified
But in his rascality and the lawlessness of his conduct there was no moderation or abatement
And it was on him that the hope of the Romans centred as he marched once more against the Persians, leaving his wife in Byzantium
Now if your father were willing, we should most easily organize this project and accomplish whatever God wills
In saying this she seemed to John to speak well, and a certain day was appointed to carry out the plan
So these departed for this task
But in the natural confusion which resulted the bodyguards of John for they stood close by came immediately to his side
But God, I think, did not suffer Johns retribution to end thus, but prepared for him a greater punishment
And it fell out thus
Now it happened that John had become especially hostile to Eusebius, and hence the suspicion of the plot fell upon him
Accordingly men were sent from the senate to investigate this act of pollution
Thus begging everywhere along the way he was conveyed to the city of Antinous in Aegypt
And this is now the third year during which they have been guarding him there in confinement
Thus then John the Cappadocian ten years afterward was overtaken by this punishment for his political career
So then Justinian made a present of money to Chosroes, and not long afterwards dismissed the envoys
In the city of Daras the following event took place
Then he established himself in a palace as if in a citadel, and was strengthening his tyranny every day
But as it was, this was prevented by the agreement which had already been reached, as I have said
And first at the door of the courtyard they found some few of the bodyguards, whom they slew immediately
Such, then, was the progress of events touching this tyranny

And he conferred with Alamoundaras concerning this matter and commanded him to provide causes for war
And this was true
For no mention of Saracens was ever made in treaties, on the ground that they were included under the names of Persians and Romans
This Summus was the brother of Julian, who not long before had served as envoy to the Aethiopians and Homeritae
The Emperor Justinian, therefore, took the matter under consideration, and a long time was spent in the settlement of the question
This letter he asserted to have been put into his hands by the Huns themselves who had come before him
So then Chosroes, with these charges against the Romans, was purposing to break off the treaty
But as to whether he was speaking the truth in these matters, I am not able to say
For inasmuch as they were at peace, they were not keeping a strict guard over that region
Use, therefore, this good chance while the time fits, lest thou seek for it after it has ceased
For when once the time of opportunity has passed, it is not its nature to return again
When Chosroes heard this, it seemed to him that Vittigis advised well, and he was still more eager to break off the treaty
But because he wished the thing he willingly consented to be persuaded
For these accusations one might make also against Cyrus, the King of the Persians, and Alexander, the Macedonian
But justice is never accustomed to dwell together with envy
For these reasons, then, Chosroes was purposing to break off the treaty
III At this same time another event also occurred it was as follows
And becoming master of these places, he was plotted against and murdered by those who had formerly possessed them
After this crime had been committed, the perpetrators of the murder fled into the land of Persia
They were two brothers, sons of Perozes
And when the Emperor heard this, he gave over the villages to Amazaspes, the nephew of Symeon, and appointed him ruler over the Armenians
After telling this, Acacius, by the emperors will, slew Amazaspes treacherously, and himself secured the command over the Armenians by the gift of the emperor
For he plundered their property without excuse and ordained that they should pay an unheardof tax of four centenaria
But the Armenians, unable to bear him any longer, conspired together and slew Acacius and fled for refuge to Pharangium
Therefore the emperor sent Sittas against them from Byzantium
For Sittas had been delaying there since the time when the treaty was made with the Persians
And the tribe called the Aspetiani, great in power and in numbers, was willing to join him
But by some chance those who carried the tablets went by another road and did not succeed at all in meeting the Aspetiani
But they, being now possessed with anger, arrayed themselves for battle with all the rest
Both parties were horsemen
For it happened that he had no helmet on his head
Thus it did not escape the enemy that he had come there with only a few men
But some say that Sittas did not die at the hand of Artabanes, but that Solomon, a very insignificant man among the Armenians, destroyed him
Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes nor were they willing to receive his proposals
Bassaces, the soninlaw, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly
Now we shall begin our account from a little distance back in order that you may be able to follow the whole course of events
And this thou thyself shalt know at no distant time, as soon as he is able to subdue completely the people of the West
We omit to speak of the fate of the Libyans and of the Italians
The whole earth is not large enough for the man it is too small a thing for him to conquer all the world together
But he is even looking about the heavens and is searching the retreats beyond the ocean, wishing to gain for himself some other world
But the chief thing has not yet been spoken
The peace, therefore, as far as concerns him, has already been broken for thee, and he himself has set an end to the endless peace
For the crime has been committed by him who attempts it, even though success be lacking
Now as for the course which the war will follow, this is surely clear to everyone
Nay more, the contest will not be evenly matched for us even in point of strength
For disregarding his master, he has remained in the West, holding the power of Italy himself
For it was the late autumn season, in the thirteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian
At that time also the comet appeared, at first about as long as a tall man, but later much larger
And the end of it was toward the west and its beginning toward the east, and it followed behind the sun itself
For the sun was in Capricorn and it was in Sagittarius
For from the Ionian Gulf these barbarians plundered everything in order as far as the suburbs of Byzantium
And taking with them the money and leading away one hundred and twenty thousand captives, they all retired homeward without encountering any opposition
In later times too they often came there and brought upon the Romans irreparable calamity
In this way they destroyed almost all the Greeks except the Peloponnesians, and then withdrew
Belisarius, after humbling Vittigis, the king of the Goths and Italians, brought him alive to Byzantium
And I shall now proceed to tell how the army of the Persians invaded the land of the Romans
When the Emperor Justinian perceived that Chosroes was eager for war, he wished to offer him some counsel and to dissuade him from the undertaking
But when they have brought about war according to their intention, to return again to peace is for men, I think, not easy
For the crimes of those who have done wrong are made manifest to their neighbours by their acts, not by their thoughts
But this would not seem to be becoming even to ordinary men, much less to kings
When Chosroes saw this message, he neither made any immediate answer nor did he dismiss Anastasius, but he compelled him to remain there
But he did not enter by the country between the rivers, but advanced with the Euphrates on his right
And a long second wall outside the fortress cuts off the land between the two rivers, and completes the form of a triangle around Circesium
But meeting with no success, he hastened his march forward
There it happened that the horse on which Chosroes was riding neighed and stamped the ground with his foot
And the Magi considered the meaning of this incident and announced that the place would be captured
Chosroes then made camp and led his army against the fortifications to assail the wall
And the guards pushed and struggled still more, but were quite unable to get the gate back to the threshold
On the other hand they dared not open it again, since they perceived that it was held by the enemy
But some say that it was not a stone but a block of wood which the Persians threw into the gateway
Then he dismissed Anastasius, bidding him announce to the Emperor Justinian where in the world he had left Chosroes, son of Cabades
But the bishop, alleging that he had no money, refused absolutely to undertake the matter
And after setting down these things in writing, Candidus received all the inhabitants of Sura
And some few among them survived, but the majority, unable to support the misery which had fallen to their lot, succumbed soon afterwards
After the settlement of this affair Chosroes led his army forward
How great, now, the army of Chosroes is you are assuredly informed
So spoke Bouzes and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing
For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off
And where in the world he was neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn
Such, then, was the course of these events
But to the architects of public buildings it seemed that neither one of these things should be done
Germanus, though disappointed in this plan, had some hope at first because he expected an army from Byzantium
He therefore threatened to destroy all the Syrians and Cilicians, and bidding Megas follow him, he led his army to Hierapolis
This city lies between Antioch and Hierapolis, at a distance from both of twodays journey for an unencumbered traveller
And so on the fourth day he reached Antioch, while the Persians came to the suburb of Beroea
And he commanded them to set ladders against the wall and to make trial of mounting it, and they did as directed
By this time the king was furious with anger and he fired nearly the whole city
He then mounted the acropolis and decided to storm the fortress
Such, then, was the situation of the Beroeans
Megas, upon reaching Antioch and announcing the terms arranged by him with Chosroes, failed utterly to persuade them to carry out this agreement
For it happened that the Emperor Justinian had sent John, the son of Rufinus, and Julian, his private secretary, as ambassadors to Chosroes
The person holding this office is styled a secretis by the Romans for secrets they are accustomed to call secreta
These men had reached Antioch and were remaining there
For this reason Megas returned unsuccessful
But Ephraemius, the bishop of Antioch, fearing the attack of the Persians, went into Cilicia
There too came Germanus not long afterwards, taking with him some few men but leaving the most of them in Antioch
For to pay a thing which one does not possess could not be made possible for a man by any device
Let this, then, be my defence for the moment in behalf of these men
But if I should be able to have converse with the sufferers, I should have something else also to say which has now escaped me
So spoke Megas, and Chosroes permitted him to go into the acropolis
Moved by the tearful entreaties of the man Chosroes fulfilled his request, and binding himself by an oath, gave pledges to all on the acropolis
Then the Beroeans, after coming into such great danger, left the acropolis free from harm, and departing went each his own way
VIII June A
Some of the population of Antioch thereupon departed from there with their money and fled as each one could
Not long after this the Persian army also came
There they all pitched their tents and made camp fronting on the River Orontes and not very far from the stream
On account of this Chosroes, boiling with anger, decided to storm the wall
For at this place, as has been stated by me above, the wall of fortification was most vulnerable
Thereupon the Romans, since the structure on which they were to stand when fighting was very narrow, devised the following remedy
So the Persians, pressing on most vigorously from all sides, were sending their arrows thickly everywhere, and especially along the crest of the hill
Meanwhile the Romans were fighting them back with all their strength, not soldiers alone, but also many of the most courageous youths of the populace
But it appeared that those who were attacking the wall there were engaged in a battle on even terms with their enemy
But the Persians, with no one opposing them, set ladders against the wall and mounted with no difficulty
But some say that it was by the will of Chosroes that the Persians hesitated
For this reason too the Persians also made signs to the fugitives with their hands, urging them to flee as quickly as possible
Some of them were in heavy armour, but the majority were unarmed and using only stones as missiles
And pushing back the enemy they raised the paean, and with shouts proclaimed the Emperor Justinian triumphant, as if they had won the victory
At this point Chosroes, seated on the tower which is on the height, summoned the ambassadors, wishing to say something
For already the Persians had forced back the citizens by their numbers and turned them to flight, and a great slaughter took place there
For the Persians did not spare persons of any age and were slaying all whom they met, old and young alike
Thus the inhabitants of Antioch were visited with every form of misfortune
For to trample upon captives is not holy
But as for these matters, let them be as God wishes
When he had finished these things, he gave orders to the Persians to burn the whole city
And the ambassadors begged him to withhold his hand only from the church, for which he had carried away ransom in abundance
This man, Tatianus by name, was an especially discreet person, a native of Mopsuestia
The barbarians burned also the parts outside the fortifications, except the sanctuary which is dedicated to St
Julianus and the houses which stand about this sanctuary
For it happened that the ambassadors had taken up their lodgings there
As for the fortifications, the Persians left them wholly untouched
For he who submits to be worsted in evil things would in better things justly be victorious
So spoke the ambassadors
For friendship, he said, which is made by men on terms of money is generally spent as fast as the money is used up
It was necessary, therefore, that the Romans should pay some definite annual sum to the Persians
So, said the ambassadors, the Persians desire to have the Romans subject and tributary to themselves
This man, seeing one of the young men of Antioch on foot and alone concealing himself there, separated from the others and pursued him
Now the young man was a butcher, Aeimachus by name
And the rider fell immediately to the ground, whereupon the youth drew out his sword and slew him
Such, then, was the course of these events
But Chosroes with his whole army proceeded on the way to Apamea
And he did as they requested
Then indeed it befell that a sight surpassing both description and belief was there seen
Then upon learning that the army of the enemy had come close to the city, he went in great haste to Chosroes
Therefore, said Chosroes, receive me into the city accompanied by a few men with all the gates opened wide
And the priest said Yes, for I have come here to invite thee to do this very thing
So the whole army pitched their tents and made camp before the fortifications
Then Chosroes chose out two hundred of the best of the Persians and entered the city
But God, as has been said, preserved Apamea
So spoke the priest
And Chosroes yielded and fulfilled the request
And he himself went up there also, eager to be a spectator of the performances
And he was followed in the same tracks by the wearer of the green colour
At that time one of the citizens of Apamea came before Chosroes and accused a Persian of entering his house and violating his maiden daughter
Upon hearing this, Chosroes, boiling with anger, commanded that the man should be brought
And when he came before him, he directed that he should be impaled in the camp
And Chosroes promised that he would release the man to them, but he secretly impaled him not long afterwards
So after these things had been thus accomplished, he departed and marched back with the whole army
And those who were left behind returned to their native land as each one could
Then a sort of ambition came over Chosroes to capture the city of Edessa
There was a certain Augarus in early times, toparch of Edessa for thus the kings of the different nations were called then
A long time, therefore, was consumed by him in this visit
So the attendants did as he directed
And Augustus looked upon the performance carefully for a very long time, and he was wondering that nature untaught makes animals miss their native land
And when Augarus had secured this, he begged of Augustus to build him a hippodrome in the city of Edessa
And he granted also this
Thus then Augarus departed from Rome and came to Edessa
And the citizens enquired of him whether he had come bringing any good thing for them from the Emperor Augustus
At a later time when Augarus was well advanced in years, he was seized with an exceedingly violent attack of gout
And they say that he added this also that never would the city be liable to capture by the barbarians
The city did in fact come under the Medes a short time afterwards, not by capture however, but in the following manner
he is eager to attach it to his cause, judging by what has happened in my time, which I shall present in the appropriate place
As for these things, then, let them be as God wills, and so let them be told
For this reason it seemed to Chosroes at that time a matter of moment to capture Edessa
When with difficulty Chosroes reached the neighbourhood of Edessa, they say that suppuration set in in his face and his jaw became swollen
For this reason he was quite unwilling to make an attempt on the city, but he sent Paulus and demanded money from the citizens
And Chosroes took the money and kept the agreement
And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheardof zeal
And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing
For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain
Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives
But when, likewise, the citizens of Constantina offered money, he accepted it, although he asserted that the city belonged to him from his fathers
For at the time when Cabades took Amida, he wished also to capture Edessa and Constantina
And when Cabades heard this, he was convinced and led his army on to Constantina
And upon arriving there, he issued orders to the whole army to encamp for a siege
For this reason it was that Chosroes claimed that the city belonged to him from his fathers
However no one of the barbarians dared to get inside
Next he decided to make a tunnel secretly at the eastern side of the city
For at this point alone can the earth be dug, since the other parts of the fortifications were set upon rock by the builders
So the Persians began to dig, beginning from their trench
Then he told them of everything and commanded them all to be on the watch and to take all possible care for their safety
The Persians, on the other hand, not knowing what was being done, were pushing on the work no less than before
And the first of them the Romans killed, while those in the rear by fleeing at top speed into the camp saved themselves
For the Romans decided by no means to pursue them in the dark
Such were the fortunes of the Romans during the first invasion of Chosroes and the summer drew to its close
For he brought with him charioteers and musicians both from Antioch and from the other Roman cities
Thus, then, the portent which had come to the citizens of Antioch in the reign of Anastasius reached this final fulfilment for them
And finally in this capture the whole city, as has been said, was destroyed
Such, then, was the calamity which befell the men of Antioch
For Martinus had been sent immediately to the East, and for this reason Chosroes found him at Daras, as has been stated above
And among the Goths, Vittigis remained in Byzantium, but all the rest marched with Belisarius against Chosroes
Such, then, was the course of these events
And Belisarius and his followers went in haste, since he was eager to anticipate Chosroes making any second invasion into the land of the Romans
XV But in the meantime Chosroes was leading his army against Colchis, where the Lazi were calling him in for the following reason
And since his owner showed him great kindness, he attended the school of a grammatist
This man unsettled and threw into confusion all the relations of the Romans and the Lazi
And now we and the king of Lazica give to the Persians both ourselves and our land to treat in any way you may desire
But it is worth while to tell a few of the things which the accursed Romans have dared to do against us
For there is no obstacle between
So spoke the envoys
And they promised that they themselves would be guides of the route, and would take the lead in this work for the Persians
And Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with his whole army
For war is wont to succeed by reason of careful planning more than by anything else
Now it is necessary that those who gather for deliberation should make their minds entirely free from modesty and from fear
Thus spoke Belisarius
And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation against the enemys country
And their opinion was followed immediately by the whole council
Agreeing, therefore, to release both of them with their followers within sixty days, he commanded them also to follow with the rest of the army
So Belisarius was making his preparation for the invasion with great zeal
For this reason they closed in still more around the fortifications, so as to set up ladders immediately, since no one was defending the wall
And neither seeing nor hearing anything of the enemy, they sent to Chosroes and explained the situation
And Chosroes, filled with rage, impaled Aniabedes, since he had been outgeneralled by John, a tradesman and an altogether unwarlike man
But some say that not Aniabedes, but the officer commanding the men who were working the ram was impaled
And he himself broke camp with the whole army, and coming close to the fortifications of Petra, made camp and began a siege
And bringing up the whole army there, he opened the action, commanding all to shoot with their bows against the parapet
The Romans, meanwhile, in defending themselves, made use of their engines of war and all their bows
And it has only one approach on the level ground, and that not very broad for exceedingly high cliffs overhang it on either side
And they built two towers, one in each of these walls, not following the customary plan, but as follows
Such, then, are the fortifications of Petra
Thus Chosroes captured Petra
And there he gave orders to make a camp at about fortytwo stades from the city of Nisibis
But all the others marvelled greatly that he did not wish to camp close to the fortifications, and some were quite unwilling to follow him
Belisarius therefore addressed those of the officers who were about him thus It was not my wish to disclose to all what I am thinking
For talk carried about through a camp cannot keep secrets, for it advances little by little until it is carried out even to the enemy
And the proof of this you have near at hand
If, therefore, the conflict should be close by the city, the struggle will not be even for us and the Persians
But if the enemy engage with us here and we conquer them, I have great hopes, fellow officers, of capturing the city
When Belisarius had said this, all the others except Peter were convinced, and they made camp and remained with him
And when this was observed by Nabedes, he led the Persian army running at full speed against them
And the Romans together with the Goths followed them up and slew a hundred and fifty men
For the pursuit was only of short duration, and the others quickly got inside the fortifications
Accordingly he broke camp and moved forward with the whole army
And after accomplishing a days journey, they came upon a fortress which the Persians call Sisauranon
For the wall happened to be extremely strong, and the barbarians defended it against their assailants with the greatest vigour
Now exactly this has happened to us in the present case
For stupid daring leads to destruction, but discreet hesitation is well adapted always to save those who adopt such a course
Let us therefore establish ourselves here and endeavour to capture this fortress, and let Arethas with his forces be sent into the country of Assyria
For the Saracens are by nature unable to storm a wall, but the cleverest of all men at plundering
These words of Belisarius seemed to all well spoken, and he straightway put the plan into execution
So Arethas and his men crossed the River Tigris and entered Assyria
And since a great number of persons had taken refuge suddenly in the fortress, they were naturally hard pressed by the want of provisions
And the emperor not long afterwards sent these Persians and Bleschames to Italy to fight against the Goths
Such, then, was the course of events which had to do with the fortress of Sisauranon
But Arethas, fearing lest he should be despoiled of his booty by the Romans, was now unwilling to return to the camp
For this reason, then, he advised Trajan and John to return by another route to the land of the Romans
But Belisarius and the Roman army, hearing nothing concerning this force, were disturbed, and they were filled with fear and an intolerable and exaggerated suspicion
Belisarius therefore called together all the officers and opened a discussion
And this reputation has come to prevail not alone among the Romans, but also among all barbarians
For I would have you look thus at the situation of this army
For as for going forward, I consider it impossible even to be spoken of
So spoke John, and all the others expressed approval, and becoming disorderly, they demanded that the retreat be made with all speed
Accordingly Belisarius laid the sick in the carts and let them lead the way, while he led the army behind them
So ended the invasion of the Romans
Such, then, were the events which took place in the second invasion of Chosroes
And Belisarius went to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor, and passed the winter there
And Candidus entreated him to send men to Sergiopolis to take all the treasures of the sanctuary there
And when Chosroes followed this suggestion, Candidus sent some of his followers with them
But Chosroes said that these were by no means sufficient for him, and demanded that he should receive others still more than these
Accordingly he sent men, ostensibly to search out with all diligence the wealth of the city, but in reality to take possession of the city
Thus those who were sent by Chosroes returned to him unsuccessful, and he, boiling with anger, began to make plans to capture the city
He accordingly sent an army of six thousand, commanding them to begin a siege and to make assaults upon the fortifications
For, as it happened, they had not more than two hundred soldiers
However, Chosroes never released Candidus
For it was necessary, I suppose, that since he had disregarded his sworn agreement, he should be a priest no longer
Such, then, was the course of these events
And his purpose was to lead the army straight for Palestine, in order that he might plunder all their treasures and especially those in Jerusalem
For he had it from hearsay that this was an especially goodly land and peopled by wealthy inhabitants
The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them
Such was the message of the letter
But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates
For this would justly be called not salvation but treason
But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits
When Belisarius learned this, he did as follows
And these men did as directed
And he arranged the soldiers as follows
On either side of the tent were Thracians and Illyrians, with Goths beyond them, and next to these Eruli, and finally Vandals and Moors
And their line extended for a great distance over the plain
And each one had his horsewhip, but for weapons one had a sword, another an axe, another an uncovered bow
And all gave the impression that they were eager to be off on the hunt with never a thought of anything else
But he first comes into the midst of the Romans, and then begins to offer suggestions concerning peace
With such words as these he dismissed the ambassador
And when Abandanes came to Chosroes, he advised him to take his departure with all possible speed
Chosroes was convinced by this admonition and wished to turn back to his own country, but he found himself in a very perplexing situation
Now Belisarius knew well that not even a hundred thousand men would ever be sufficient to check the crossing of Chosroes
For this reason he commanded Diogenes and Adolius to remain quiet
Chosroes, accordingly, constructed a bridge with great celerity and crossed the River Euphrates suddenly with his whole army
Then Belisarius also with the whole Roman army crossed the River Euphrates and immediately sent to Chosroes
And they asked of him that he treat the Romans as his friends in his journey through their land
But in the meantime Chosroes, disregarding the agreement, took the city of Callinicus which was entirely without defenders
And it happened that great numbers of farmers had gathered there
These Chosroes enslaved and razed everything to the ground
A little later, upon receiving the hostage, John, he retired to his own country
And the Armenians who had submitted to Chosroes received pledges from the Romans and came with Bassaces to Byzantium
Such was the fortune of the Romans in the third invasion of Chosroes
During these times there was a pestilence, by which the whole human race came near to being annihilated
And it attacked some in the summer season, others in the winter, and still others at the other times of the year
It started from the Aegyptians who dwell in Pelusium
And this disease always took its start from the coast, and from there went up to the interior
And in the second year it reached Byzantium in the middle of spring, where it happened that I was staying at that time
And it came as follows
And they were taken in the following manner
It was natural, therefore, that not one of those who had contracted the disease expected to die from it
Up to this point, then, everything went in about the same way with all who had taken the disease
For there ensued with some a deep coma, with others a violent delirium, and in either case they suffered the characteristic symptoms of the disease
For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot all those who were familiar to them and seemed to be sleeping constantly
And if anyone cared for them, they would eat without waking, but some also were neglected, and these would die directly through lack of sustenance
And those who were attending them were in a state of constant exhaustion and had a most difficult time of it throughout
They had also great difficulty in the matter of eating, for they could not easily take food
And upon opening some of the swellings, they found a strange sort of carbuncle that had grown inside them
With many also a vomiting of blood ensued without visible cause and straightway brought death
For example, while some were helped by bathing, others were harmed in no less degree
And of those who received no care many died, but others, contrary to reason, were saved
And again, methods of treatment shewed different results with different patients
And in the case of women who were pregnant death could be certainly foreseen if they were taken with the disease
For some died through miscarriage, but others perished immediately at the time of birth with the infants they bore
With others who survived the tongue did not remain unaffected, and they lived on either lisping or speaking incoherently and with difficulty
XXIII Now the disease in Byzantium ran a course of four months, and its greatest virulence lasted about three
For this reason it came about that some of the notable men of the city because of the universal destitution remained unburied for many days
And it fell to the lot of the emperor, as was natural, to make provision for the trouble
In the Latin tongue the Romans designate this office by the term referendarius
So those who had not as yet fallen into complete destitution in their domestic affairs attended individually to the burial of those connected with them
At that time all the customary rites of burial were overlooked
But these things were displayed to the world in later times
And if one did succeed in meeting a man going out, he was carrying one of the dead
Indeed in a city which was simply abounding in all good things starvation almost absolute was running riot
Such was the course of the pestilence in the Roman empire at large as well as in Byzantium
And it fell also upon the land of the Persians and visited all the other barbarians besides
In that place is the great sanctuary of fire, which the Persians reverence above all other gods
This is the fire which the Romans worshipped under the name of Hestia in ancient times
And Chosroes remained quiet expecting these men
For he knew well that no one of the enemy would stand in their way
And he commanded them to gather all in one place and so make their invasion into Persarmenia
When the commanders received these letters, all of them together with their followers began to gather into the land of Armenia
This fortress is separated from Theodosiopolis by a journey of four days
There too Peter came not long afterwards together with Adolius and some other commanders
Now the troops in this region were commanded by Isaac, the brother of Narses
And Philemouth and Beros with the Eruli who were under them came into the territory of Chorzianene, not far from the camp of Martinus
Thus then were encamped the Roman commanders with their troops and the whole army amounted to thirty thousand men
Now all these troops were neither gathered into one place, nor indeed was there any general meeting for conference
But the generals sent to each other some of their followers and began to make enquiries concerning the invasion
Suddenly, however, Peter, without communicating with anyone, and without any careful consideration, invaded the hostile land with his troops
And when on the following day this was found out by Philemouth and Beros, the leaders of the Eruli, they straightway followed
And when this in turn came to the knowledge of Martinus and Valerianus and their men, they quickly joined in the invasion
As for the others, they proceeded in a body straight for Doubios, neither plundering nor damaging in any other way the land of the Persians
And the priest of the Christians is called Catholicos in the Greek tongue, because he presides alone over the whole region
So Nabedes with stones and carts blocked up the entrances into the village and thus made it still more difficult of access
And he asserted that the man had retired from Anglon with the whole Median army
And when Narses heard this, he was indignant, and he heaped reproaches and abuse upon his fellowcommanders for their hesitation
For the soldiers marched forward, mixed in with the baggage train, as if going to the ready plunder of great wealth
But when they came near to Anglon, they sent out spies who returned to them announcing the array of the enemy
Now Peter held the right wing and Valerianus the left, while Martinus and his men arrayed themselves in the centre
And when they came close to their opponents, they halted, preserving their formation, but not without disorder
And then Narses urged his men forward and pressed still harder upon the enemy, and the rest of the Romans joined in the action
And his brother Isaac carried him out from among the fighting men, mortally wounded
And he died shortly afterwards, having proved himself a brave man in this engagement
Then, as was to be expected, great confusion fell upon the Roman army, and Nabedes let out the whole Persian force upon his opponents
Such is the custom of the Eruli
And this proved a disaster for the Romans so great as to exceed anything that had ever befallen them previously
For great numbers of them perished and still more fell into the hands of the enemy
As for the forces of Justus and Peranius, they invaded the country about Taraunon, and after gathering some little plunder, immediately returned
And in the following year, Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the fourth time invaded the land of the Romans, leading his army towards Mesopotamia
So the barbarians were already laying hold of the sheep, and the shepherds were trying most valiantly to prevent them
Now one of the Huns who was fighting before the others was making more trouble for the Romans than all the rest
So the Romans went inside the fortifications, while the barbarians pitched their tents and made camp in a body about seven stades from the city
Accordingly he decided to sell his withdrawal to the citizens of Edessa for a great sum of money
And they with all speed chose out four of their illustrious men and sent them
And the envoys said that they would give as much as they had provided before, when he came against them after capturing Antioch
And Zaberganes dismissed them with laughter, telling them to deliberate most carefully concerning their safety and then to come again to the Persians
For there was never a war whose outcome might be taken for granted by those who waged it
Thereupon Chosroes in anger commanded the envoys to be gone with all speed
From that time on, however, the barbarians kept a careful guard, and there was no further opportunity for anyone to go out against them
Wherefore the barbarians devised the following plan
And yet least of all cities should Edessa suffer any adversity at thy hand
For men, as a general thing, bring down upon their own heads the most of the misfortunes which are going to befall them
Such were the words of Stephanus
Such then were the words which Chosroes hurled forth, being in hopes of capturing Edessa with no trouble
And the ambassadors since all the conditions which he had announced to them seemed impossible, in despair and great vexation, proceeded to the city
And when they had come inside the citywall, they reported the message from Chosroes, and the whole city was filled with tumult and lamentation
Now the artificial hill was rising to a great height and was being pushed forward with much haste
And the Romans, being at a loss what to do, again sent off the envoys to Chosroes
At first, then, the Romans tried to overtop the wall opposite the hill by means of another structure
He then came up close to the enemys camp and began to converse with some of the Persian commanders
By this means they were planning to burn the embankment
Accordingly the Romans straightway set fire to the treetrunks which had been prepared for this purpose
But they kept throwing fresh wood into the pit, not slackening their efforts for a moment
But since the trouble increased, the barbarians rushed up to help in great numbers, and the Romans, shooting them from the wall, killed many
Then even the flames rose and appeared clearly above the embankment, and the Persians abandoned this undertaking
But Chosroes about midday sent a large part of the army against the socalled Great Gate in order to storm the wall
Now it was already some days since Rhecinarius had arrived at the camp of the barbarians
And Chosroes, suspecting that the reason was not a sound one, prepared for battle
Such, then, was the purpose of Chosroes in arranging the army in this way
And the fighting began early in the morning, and at first the Persians had the advantage
Meanwhile the women and children, and the aged also, were gathering stones for the fighters and assisting them in other ways
But Chosroes, in a passion of anger, drove them all on with threats and urged them forward against the enemy
Only Azarethes at the socalled Soinian Gate was still fighting with his men, at the place which they call Tripurgia
Then the Emperor Justinian sent Constantianus and Sergius a second time to Chosroes to arrange the truce
These two towns are separated by the Tigris River only, for they have nothing else between them
When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he immediately sent both Tribunus and the money, amounting to twenty centenaria
And Arethas came within a little of capturing alive two of the sons of Alamoundaras however, he did not actually succeed
Such, then, was the course of events among the Saracens
For in the third year of the truce he devised the following schemes
For he considered that, as regards the barbarians dwelling in the Caucasus, Lazica was nothing else than a bulwark against them
For these reasons, then, Chosroes was anxious to gain possession of Lazica, but in the Lazi he had not the least confidence
For since the time when the Romans had withdrawn from Lazica, the common people of the country naturally found the Persian rule burdensome
For the Persians are beyond all other men singular in their ways, and they are excessively rigid as regards the routine of daily life
And their laws are difficult of access for all men, and their requirements quite unbearable
And apart from this, salt is produced nowhere in Lazica, nor indeed does grain grow there nor the vine nor any other good thing
When, therefore, Chosroes perceived this, he was eager to anticipate with certainty any move on their part to revolt against him
But George, paying no heed to him in his fury, saved the city for the Romans
For he received Isdigousnas into the city with only twenty men
For no one ever saw an interpreter become a tablecompanion of even one of the more humble officials, not to speak of a king
So the plot against the city of Daras ended in this way for Chosroes
XXIX His first move against Lazica was as follows
Now when this lumber had been conveyed to Lazica, it happened that it was struck suddenly by lightning and reduced to ashes
But Pharsanses secretly revealed to Goubazes what was being prepared
He, accordingly, did not come to Phabrizus at all, but began openly to plan a revolt
For if left by themselves the Colchians would not be able to repel the power of the Persians
And Chosroes, being greatly disturbed by these things, dispatched a great army of horse and foot against the besiegers, putting Mermeroes in command of them
And when Goubazes learned of this, he considered the matter together with Dagisthaeus and acted in the manner which I shall presently set forth
The river Boas rises close to the territory of the Tzani among the Armenians who dwell around Pharangium
Moreover there are two cities of the greatest importance in that region, Rhodopolis and Mocheresis
Adjoining this land is the home of the Romans who are called Pontic
And yet Lazica is everywhere difficult to traverse both to the right and to the left of the River Phasis
For there are on both sides of the river exceedingly high and jagged mountains, and as a result the passes are narrow and very long
The Romans call the roads through such passes clisurae when they put their own word into a Greek form
But since at that time Lazica happened to be unguarded, the Persians had reached Petra very easily with the Lazi who were their guides
And Goubazes had promised that the emperor would give them this money
So Goubazes was thus engaged
But Dagisthaeus, being a rather young man and by no means competent to carry on a war against Persia, did not handle the situation properly
He himself, moreover, though besieging Petra with the whole army, accomplished nothing, although the enemy were few
But this was not sufficient greatly to disturb the Romans
And since the Romans were accomplishing nothing by assaulting the wall, they again turned to digging
Such, then, was the course of events in the Roman camp
XXX But Mermeroes, after passing the Iberian frontier with the whole Median army, was moving forward with the River Phasis on his right
For he was quite unwilling to go through the country of Lazica, lest any obstacle should confront him there
In this way he succeeded in deceiving him so that the Roman army did not immediately enter the city
So the Persians fled inside their fortifications, and the Tzani, after plundering the Roman camp proceeded straight for Rhizaeum
And from there they came to Athens and betook themselves to their homes through the territory of the Trapezuntines
Thus, then, Mermeroes with the Median army departed from there
For in depth this river is not inferior to the deepest rivers, and it spreads out to a great width
Indeed, those who navigate in those parts are able to draw up drinking water in the midst of the sea
And it happened that long before this time he had sent another considerable army also to Lazica, which had not yet arrived there
The commander of this army was Rhecithancus, from Thrace, a man of discretion and a capable warrior
Such then was the course of these events
Now when Mermeroes got into the mountains, as I have said, he was anxious to fill Petra with provisions from there
He therefore selected five thousand men and left them there, appointing as commanders over them Phabrizus and three others
For it seemed to him unnecessary to leave more men there, since there was no enemy at all
And he himself with the rest of the army came into Persarmenia and remained quietly in the country around Doubios
And pursuing them for a very great distance they came well into Iberia
There they happened upon certain others of the Persians also and slew a great number
And John the Cappadocian one year before this came to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor
For at that time the Empress Theodora had reached the term of her life
Now there was a certain priest in Byzantium, Augustus by name, who guarded the treasures of the temple of Sophia
