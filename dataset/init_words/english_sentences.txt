It was his conviction that while cleverness is appropriate to rhetoric, and inventiveness to poetry, truth alone is appropriate to history
Such, it is evident, was the archery of the past
But the bowmen of the present time go into battle wearing corselets and fitted out with greaves which extend up to the knee
From the right side hang their arrows, from the other the sword
But no such consideration will prevent the conclusion that most great and notable deeds have been performed in these wars
For Arcadius had no hope that the boys uncle, Honorius, would succour him, inasmuch as the situation in Italy was already troublesome
So Arcadius died, having thus arranged his private affairs as well as those of the empire
This came about in the following way
And when Vararanes saw him, he enquired from those who were near who this man could be who was coming forward
And they replied that he was the general of the Romans
When this treaty had been executed, both sovereigns then continued to administer the affairs of their respective countries as seemed best to them
For they are not nomads like the other Hunnic peoples, but for a long period have been established in a goodly land
As a result of this they have never made any incursion into the Roman territory except in company with the Median army
They are the only ones among the Huns who have white bodies and countenances which are not ugly
When Perozes heard this, a fear came over him lest perchance the Medes had brought harm upon themselves by their pursuit of the enemy
He therefore advanced no further, but, remaining where he was, began to consider the situation
In this way, they explained, he would be able in the future to escape the ignominy of the deed
IV Not long after this, disregarding the oath he had sworn, he was eager to avenge himself upon the Huns for the insult done him
They thereupon retorted that he had abandoned nothing, except, forsooth, the one opportunity on which, as it turned out, everything else depended
For he insisted that as yet they had received no definite information as to the invasion, for the Persians were still within their own boundaries
So, remaining where he was, he busied himself as follows
Over the trench he placed reeds, and upon the reeds he scattered earth, thereby concealing the true surface
Among them were Perozes and all his sons
This pearl the Roman Emperor then made every effort to buy from the Ephthalitae, but was utterly unsuccessful
For the barbarians were not able to find it although they sought it with great labour
However, they say that the Ephthalitae found it later and sold it to Cabades
The story of this pearl, as told by the Persians, is worth recounting, for perhaps to some it may not seem altogether incredible
Now I intend to make trial of the monster, and hope to make thee master of the pearl
And if I succeed in this struggle, it is plain that henceforth I shall be ranked among those who are counted blessed
With these words he departed
But the men who had been left upon the beach picked up the pearl, and, conveying it to the king, reported all that had happened
Such, then, is the story which the Persians relate, just as I have set it down, concerning this pearl
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thus Perozes was destroyed and the whole Persian army with him
For the few who by chance did not fall into the ditch found themselves at the mercy of the enemy
And the time these barbarians ruled over the Persians was two years
Accordingly they rose against him, removed him from the throne, and kept him in prison in chains
This he said hinting that, if they did not put Cabades to death, he would straightway make trouble for the Persians
And by the long continuance of this war it came about that both sides suffered beyond measure, and especially the Armenians
But each nation was possessed by such great distrust of the other that neither of them could make overtures of peace to their opponents
In the meantime it happened that the Persians became engaged in a war with certain other barbarians who lived not far from the Armenians
Then they fell upon them unexpectedly and killed almost the whole population, old and young alike
And when Arsaces came to him he shewed him every kindness, and treated him as a brother on an equal footing with himself
Not long after this certain persons slandered Arsaces, saying that he was purposing to undertake some seditious enterprise
Pacurius was persuaded by these men and again summoned him, intimating that he was anxious to confer with him on general matters
They, however, denied the charge, and swore most insistently that no such thing had been considered by them
At first, therefore, Pacurius kept them under guard in disgrace, but after a time he enquired of the Magi what should be done with them
They bade him cover the floor of the royal tent with earth, one half from the land of Persia, and the other half from Armenia
This the king did as directed
They said, further, that they too must be present at the conversation, for in this way there would be witnesses of all that was said
Thereupon, as if chanting a recantation, he was once more a suppliant, offering pitiable explanations to Pacurius
But when he came again to the Armenian earth, he returned to his threats
In this way he changed many times to one side and the other, and concealed none of his secrets
Then at length the Magi passed judgment against him as having violated the treaty and the oaths
Pacurius flayed Bassicius, and, making a bag of his skin, filled it with chaff and suspended it from a lofty tree
This man proved himself a capable warrior in this campaign, as Pacurius observed, and was the chief cause of the Persian victory
For this reason Pacurius begged him to make any request he wished, assuring him that he would be refused nothing by him
The Armenian asked for nothing else than that he might for one day pay homage to Arsaces in the way he might desire
Then Arsaces entertained those present with a royal banquet just as was formerly his custom
During this feast many speeches were made over the cups which greatly pleased Arsaces, and many incidents occurred which delighted his heart
But I must return to the point from which I have strayed
Now the keeper of the prison began to make advances to her, for she was exceedingly beautiful to look upon
And when Cabades learned this from his wife, he bade her give herself over to the man to treat as he wished
In this way, therefore, Cabades made his escape from the prison
For the Persian accounts do not agree with each other, and for this reason I omit the narration of them
This army the Persians were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made haste to flee in every direction
Even as he was considering this matter, chance brought it about that, without dishonouring the law, he could still keep his word
Thereafter Blases was kept in confinement, having ruled over the Persians two years
Seoses was the first and only man who held this office in Persia for it was conferred on no one before or after that time
And the kingdom was strengthened by Cabades and guarded securely for in shrewdness and activity he was surpassed by none
It was for this reason, and for no just cause, that Cabades decided to make an expedition against the Romans
Now there was among the Syrians a certain just man, Jacobus by name, who had trained himself with exactitude in matters pertaining to religion
And they had constructed for him a small roof over his head, sufficient to keep off the rain and snow
But the hands of every one of them became motionless and utterly unable to manage the bow
And he forgave them with a word, and the men were released from their distress
But he requested Cabades to grant to him all the men who during that war should come to him as fugitives
This request Cabades granted, and gave him a written pledge of his personal safety
Thus, then, did these things take place
However, Cabades did not slacken his efforts until he realized that the wall could not be successfully assailed in this way
However, the outside kept the form which it had at first assumed, and afforded no opportunity to anyone of discovering what was being done
But with the great mass of men crowding upon it with a rush, the hill suddenly fell in and killed almost all of them
Cabades, then, finding no remedy for the situation, decided to raise the siege, and he issued orders to the army to retreat on the morrow
Then indeed the besieged, as though they had no thought of their danger, began laughingly from the fortifications to jeer at the barbarians
So the Persian army remained there
The king himself on the following night came to the spot with a few men, bringing ladders which he had made ready
These men, as chance would have it, were keeping some annual religious festival to God on that day
When Cabades learned this, he brought his ladders up to the wall close by this tower
It was already day
As a result of this the Persians by their numbers gained the upper hand and overcame their antagonists in the fight
So the city was captured by storm on the eightieth day after the beginning of the siege
But this happened in later years
VIII At that time the Emperor Anastasius, upon learning that Amida was being besieged, dispatched with all speed an army of sufficient strength
For such an army, they say, was never assembled by the Romans against the Persians either before or after that time
Now this army was mustered with considerable delay, and advanced with little speed
However they did not advance together against the barbarians but they encamped apart from one another as they proceeded
When Cabades learned this for he happened to be close by, he came with all speed to the Roman frontier and confronted them
As for Celer, he had not yet arrived
And the enemy, coming up not long afterwards, captured the camp without a man in it and all the money it contained
From there they advanced swiftly against the other Roman army
At any rate they had stacked their arms and were preparing themselves a lunch for already the appropriate time of day was drawing near
Straightway, then, they fell upon them feasting and unarmed
And they say that not a man escaped from there but Patricius and Hypatius had succeeded in getting away at the beginning of the onset
However Celer, with his contingent, crossed the Nymphius River and made some sort of an invasion into Arzanene
This river is one very close to Martyropolis, about three hundred stades from Amida
So Celers troops plundered the country thereabout and returned not long after, and the whole invasion was completed in a short time
Both parties then gladly executed the terms of the agreement, and the son of Glones, upon receiving the money, delivered over Amida to the Romans
For Glones himself had already died in the following manner
And the general promised that he should have everything he desired, and thus dismissed the fellow
He then tore his garments in a dreadful manner, and, assuming the aspect of one who had been weeping, entered the city
But do you, O Master, take thought to defend yourself and us and the Persians
For if you go hunting into the outskirts of the city, you will find rare game
For the accursed rascals go about by fours or fives to do their robbery
Thus he spoke
And Glones was persuaded, and enquired of the fellow about how many Persians he thought would be sufficient for him to carry out the enterprise
Glones accordingly picked out two hundred horsemen and bade the fellow lead the way for them
Accordingly, since he seemed to Glones to speak well, he was sent forward by his own order
Then he came before the general Patricius and explained everything and the general sent with him two of his own bodyguard and a thousand soldiers
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thus the Romans by giving the money recovered Amida two years after it had been captured by the enemy
And when they got into the city, their own negligence and the hardships under which the Persians had maintained themselves were discovered
Thus, then, as has been told, began the war of the Romans and the Persians, and to this end did it come
But I shall now turn to the narration of the events touching the Caspian Gates
This path terminates in a place cut off by cliffs and, as it seems, absolutely impossible to pass through
From there on there are plains suitable for riding and extremely well watered, and extensive tracts used as pasture land for horses, and level besides
Here almost all the nations of the Huns are settled, extending as far as the Maeotic lake
If, however, they go by any other passes, they reach their destination with great difficulty, and can no longer use the same horses
For the detours which they are forced to make are many and steep besides
When this was observed by Alexander, the son of Philip, he constructed gates in the aforesaid place and established a fortress there
So Ambazouces died of disease not long afterwards, and Cabades overpowered his sons and took possession of the Gates
And Zames, who was second in age, having had one of his eyes struck out, was prevented by the law
For it is not lawful for a oneeyed man or one having any other deformity to become king over the Persians
Accordingly he sent envoys to treat of this matter and a letter to the Emperor Justinus in Byzantium
My proposal, then, is this, that you should make my son Chosroes, who will be my successor to the throne, your adopted son
Take this first resolve if you choose if you do you must agree to all its consequences
Thus spoke Proclus and the emperor and his nephew gave ear to his words and deliberated upon what should be done
He also answered Cabades by letter to the same effect
When the Romans heard this, they were indignant to think that even Lazica should be disputed by the Persians
Now the whole Persian council gathered to sit in judgment moved more by envy than by respect for the law
For they were thoroughly hostile to his office, which was unfamiliar to them, and also were embittered by the natural temper of the man
Thus, then, Seoses was condemned and was removed from among men
And the office which began with him ended also with him
For no other man has been made adrastadaran salanes
Rufinus also slandered Hypatius to the emperor
The Iberians, who live in Asia, are settled in the immediate neighbourhood of the Caspian Gates, which lie to the north of them
Adjoining them on the left towards the west is Lazica, and on the right towards the east are the Persian peoples
And just then Cabades was desirous of forcing them to adopt the rites of his own religion
Between these cities everything is held by the Huns
Now in ancient times the people of Bosporus were autonomous, but lately they had decided to become subject to the Emperor Justinus
Meanwhile Cabades sent a very considerable army against Gourgenes and the Iberians, and as general a Persian bearing the title of varizes, Boes by name
And the Persians followed after them but did nothing deserving even of mention since the circumstance of the rough country was against them
Nor indeed can anything be carried in from elsewhere on account of the narrowness of the paths, unless it be carried by men
However, the Lazi were able to live on a certain kind of millet which grows there, since they were accustomed to it
These garrisons the emperor removed from the place and commanded that Roman soldiers should be stationed there to guard the fortresses
This then happened in Lazica
These two men were both youths and wearing their first beards, bodyguards of the general Justinian, who later shared the empire with his uncle Justinus
But when a second inroad had been made by the Romans into Armenia, Narses and Aratius unexpectedly confronted them and engaged them in battle
An invasion was also made near the city of Nisibis by another Roman army under command of Libelarius of Thrace
This army retired abruptly in flight although no one came out against thorn
And because of this the emperor reduced Libelarius from his office and appointed Belisarius commander of the troops in Daras
It was at that time that Procopius, who wrote this history, was chosen as his adviser
, Not long after this Justinus, who had declared his nephew Justinian emperor with him, died, and thus the empire came to Justinian alone
These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy
Among these was Coutzes himself
After this the Emperor Justinian appointed Belisarius General of the East and bade him make an expedition against the Persians
And he collected a very formidable army and came to Daras
The emperor also sent Rufinus as ambassador, commanding him to remain in Hierapolis on the Euphrates River until he himself should give the word
For already much was being said on both sides concerning peace
And when they heard this, they prepared for the battle as follows
Now this trench was not dug in a straight line, but in the following manner
Among the leaders of this army were Pityaxes and the oneeyed Baresmanas
But one general held command over them all, a Persian, whose title was mirranes for thus the Persians designate this office, Perozes by name
This Perozes immediately sent to Belisarius bidding him make ready the bath for he wished to bathe there on the following day
Accordingly the Romans made the most vigorous preparations for the encounter, with the expectation that they would fight on the succeeding day
At sunrise, seeing the enemy advancing against them, they arrayed themselves as follows
Thus all along the trench stood the detachments of cavalry and the infantry
And behind these in the middle stood the forces of Belisarius and Hermogenes
And the Romans retired a short distance to the rear
The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the part of the enemy
Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly rushed upon them
In this skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies thereafter both armies remained quietly in position
And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast
And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth
Thus both armies passed that night
The best general, therefore, is that one who is able to bring about peace from war
For here we shall be compelled either to die or grow old until you accord to us justice in deed
Such was the reply which the mirranes wrote back
Such was the message of this letter
But let the bath and lunch be in readiness for me within the fortifications
When Belisarius and his generals read this, they prepared themselves for the conflict
For this reason too it happened that they were not thrown into confusion, for they had not yet come into the dangers of battle
With this exhortation the mirranes began to lead his army against the enemy
This thing you now have the opportunity to set right with no trouble
If therefore you are willing to give heed to the orders given, you will straightway win for yourselves the superiority in battle
For the Persians come against us basing their confidence on nothing else than our disorder
But this time also they will be disappointed in this hope, and will depart just as in the previous encounter
And the barbarians, coming up before them, took their stand facing the Romans
But the detachment of the socalled Immortals alone he ordered to remain at rest until he himself should give the signal
And he took his own station at the middle of the front, putting Pityaxes in command on the right wing, and Baresmanas on the left
In this manner, then, both armies were drawn up
Thus he spoke, and, since it pleased Belisarius and his staff, he carried out this plan
But up to midday neither side began battle
For a steady wind blew from their side against the barbarians, and checked to a considerable degree the force of their arrows
On the Roman side the left wing was suffering especially
When this was observed by the men under Sunicas and Aigan, they charged against them at full speed
And the Persians, seeing the forces of Sunicas too already coming up against them from the flank, turned to a hasty flight
And the rout became complete, for the Romans here joined forces with each other, and there was a great slaughter of the barbarians
And the Romans did not continue their pursuit, but both sides took their stand facing each other in line
Such was the course of these events
But the mirranes stealthily sent to the left a large body of troops and with them all the socalled Immortals
Thereupon the Romans in the angle, and all who were behind them, advanced with great ardour against the pursuers
Among these happened to be the standard bearer of Baresmanas, whom Sunicas charged and struck with his spear
For those in flight before them understood what was happening and turned back again
There the Romans held their ground
And first Sunicas killed Baresmanas and threw him from his horse to the ground
As a result of this the barbarians were seized with great fear and thought no longer of resistance, but fled in utter confusion
And the Romans, having made a circle as it were around them, killed about five thousand
Thus both armies were all set in motion, the Persians in retreat, and the Romans in pursuit
However, the pursuit was not continued by the Romans over a great distance
For on that day the Persians had been defeated in battle by the Romans, a thing which had not happened for a long time
Thus the two armies separated from each other
And the Persians were no longer willing to fight a pitched battle with the Romans
However, some sudden attacks were made on both sides, in which the Romans were not at a disadvantage
Such, then, was the fortune of the armies in Mesopotamia
XV And Cabades sent another army into the part of Armenia which is subject to the Romans
This army was composed of Persarmenians and Sunitae, whose land adjoins that of the Alani
There were also Huns with them, of the stock called Sabiri, to the number of three thousand, a most warlike race
And Mermeroes, a Persian, had been made general of the whole force
Now the general of Armenia was, as it happened, Dorotheus, a man of discretion and experienced in many wars
And Sittas held the office of general in Byzantium, and had authority over the whole army in Armenia
And both of these men got into the barbarian camp, and after noting everything accurately, they departed
And they were travelling toward some place in that region, when they happened unexpectedly upon hostile Huns
Thereupon the Romans, after killing a large number and plundering the camp, immediately marched back
Not long after this Mermeroes, having collected the whole army, invaded the Roman territory, and they came upon their enemy near the city of Satala
There they established themselves in camp and remained at rest in a place called Octava, which is fiftysix stades distant from the city
On the following day the barbarians came up close to the fortifications and busily set about closing in the town
They thus put the Persians between their own troops, and turned them to flight
And both sides kept making advances upon their opponents and retiring quickly, for they were all cavalry
And though he himself was overtaken and fell there, hacked to pieces, he proved to be the chief cause of the victory for the Romans
Wherefore also the Roman emperor sent them each year a fixed amount of gold, with the condition that they should never plunder the country thereabout
They also abandoned their own religion for a more righteous faith, and all of them became Christians
Such then was the history of the Tzani
Beyond the borders of this people there is a caon whose walls are both high and exceedingly steep, extending as far as the Caucasus mountains
In it are populous towns, and grapes and other fruits grow plentifully
When this Symeon saw that both nations were actively engaged in the war, he decided to deprive Cabades of the revenue
Therefore he gave over both himself and Pharangium to the Romans, but refused to deliver over to either one the gold of the mine
Thus he too came to Byzantium
XVI Thus matters stood with the Romans
So spoke Rufinus
And even now the Romans may choose peace, or they may elect war, by either doing justice to us or going against our rights
This was reported to the emperor by Rufinus when he came to Byzantium
XVII At the opening of spring a Persian army under the leadership of Azarethes invaded the Roman territory
They were fifteen thousand strong, all horsemen
With them was Alamoundaras, son of Saccice, with a very large body of Saracens
There is a mountain in Armenia which is not especially precipitous, twoandforty stades removed from Theodosiopolis and lying toward the north from it
From this mountain issue two springs, forming immediately two rivers, the one on the right called the Euphrates, and the other the Tigris
One of these, the Tigris, descends, with no deviations and with no tributaries except small ones emptying into it, straight toward the city of Amida
And continuing into the country which lies to the north of this city it enters the land of Assyria
For the other temple which has existed even to my day in the city of Comana is not the one Among the Taurians
But I shall explain how this temple came into being
When Orestes had departed in haste from the Taurians with his sister, it so happened that he contracted some disease
The story goes on that after Orestes had done these things, the disease continued to be as violent as before, if not even more so
I myself have often seen this place and admired it exceedingly, and have imagined that I was in the land of the Taurians
For this mountain resembles the other remarkably, since the Taurus is here also and the river Sarus is similar to the Euphrates there
But I shall return to the previous narrative
The land which lies outside the River Euphrates, beginning with Samosata, was called in ancient times Commagene, but now it is named after the river
Now this is a great dignity among the Persians, second only to the kingly honour
Thereafter Cabades began to consider in what manner he himself should make an expedition against the Romans
For after the mirranes had failed in the manner I have told, he felt confidence in no one else
For those who assume the risk of an even struggle have no assurance of victory
Now, therefore, O King of Kings, neither be thus distressed by the misfortune which has befallen Mirranes, nor desire again to make trial of fortune
For this I have often heard from the Saracens sent as spies to these parts
For the people of this city care for nothing else than ftes and luxurious living, and their constant rivalries with each other in the theatres
When Cabades heard this he could neither oppose nor distrust the plan
And he was confronted by no one at all
And, in a word, this man proved himself the most difficult and dangerous enemy of all to the Romans
For as yet we know nothing certain about him
Now the Roman army amounted to about twenty thousand foot and horse, and among them not less than two thousand were Isaurians
The Isaurians, however, were under the command of Longinus and Stephanacius
Arethas also came there to join them with the Saracen army
Accordingly they began to march back, with the River Euphrates on the left, while the Roman army was following in the rear
And in the spot where the Persians bivouacked each night the Romans always tarried on the following night
And because of this all secretly mocked him, both officers and soldiers, but not a man reproached him to his face
Finally the Persians made their bivouac on the bank of the Euphrates just opposite the city of Callinicus
Therefore it is better to enjoy the benefit of our present blessings than to seek them when they have passed
For the Persians, led on by many hopes, undertook an expedition against the Romans, and now, with everything lost, they have beaten a hasty retreat
I refrain from mentioning that some even now have not arrived
So spoke Belisarius
Thus the Romans arrayed themselves
But I say that not even if you should wish, is it within your power to make the choice between the two
Straightway both sides began the fight, and the battle was exceedingly fierce
Now already twothirds of the day had passed, and the battle was still even
But they broke their formation and moved apart, so that they got the reputation of having betrayed the Romans to the Persians
For without awaiting the oncoming enemy they all straightway beat a hasty retreat
So the Persians in this way broke through the enemys line and immediately got in the rear of the Roman cavalry
They were not in fact all Isaurians but the majority of them were Lycaones
Nevertheless the enemy were not able either to rout them or in any other way to overpower them
For their horses, annoyed by the clashing of the shields, reared up and made confusion for themselves and their riders
Thus both sides continued the struggle until it had become late in the day
However they did not find their own dead less numerous than the enemys
When Azarethes reached Persia with his army, although he had prospered in the battle, he found Cabades exceedingly ungrateful, for the following reason
Thus the law has stood from of old among the Persians
And Azarethes said that he had captured no fortress, but that he had conquered the Romans and Belisarius in battle
So Cabades bade the army of Azarethes pass by, and from the baskets each man took out a weapon just as was customary
But since many weapons were left, Cabades rebuked Azarethes for the victory and thereafter ranked him among the most unworthy
So the victory had this conclusion for Azarethes
The boundaries of Palestine extend toward the east to the sea which is called the Red Sea
Now this sea, beginning at India, comes to an end at this point in the Roman domain
On this island Hebrews had lived from of old in autonomy, but in the reign of this Justinian they have become subject to the Romans
From there on there comes a great open sea
For it is impossible to navigate in the darkness on this sea, since it is everywhere full of shoals
This coast immediately beyond the boundaries of Palestine is held by Saracens, who have been settled from of old in the Palm Groves
These groves are in the interior, extending over a great tract of land, and there absolutely nothing else grows except palm trees
Formally, therefore, the emperor holds the Palm Groves, but for him really to possess himself of any of the country there is utterly impossible
So much then for the Palm Groves
Adjoining this people there are other Saracens in possession of the coast, who are called Maddeni and who are subjects of the Homeritae
These Homeritae dwell in the land on the farther side of them on the shore of the sea
And beyond them many other nations are said to be settled as far as the maneating Saracens
Beyond these are the nations of India
But regarding these matters let each one speak as he may wish
About opposite the Homeritae on the opposite mainland dwell the Aethiopians who are called Auxomitae, because their king resides in the city of Auxomis
And the expanse of sea which lies between is crossed in a voyage of five days and nights, when a moderately favouring wind blows
All the boats which are found in India and on this sea are not made in the same manner as are other ships
Such then is the description of the socalled Red Sea and of the land which lies on either side of it
Within that space many nations are settled, and among them the Blemyes and the Nobatae, who are very large nations
But the Blemyes dwell in the central portion of the country, while the Nobatae possess the territory about the River Nile
And they receive this gold even up to my time, but none the less they overrun the country there
And for this reason he named the place Philae
But the Blemyes are accustomed also to sacrifice human beings to the sun
These sanctuaries in Philae were kept by these barbarians even up to my time, but the Emperor Justinian decided to tear them down
But I shall return to the previous narrative
Thereafter the king of the Aethiopians became afraid, and sent no further expeditions against Abramus
But this happened at a later time
So each king, promising to put this demand into effect, dismissed the ambassador, but neither one of them did the things agreed upon by them
Such then were the relations which the Romans had with the Aethiopians and the Homeritae
And the Persians once more invaded Mesopotamia with a great army under command of Chanaranges and Aspebedes and Mermeroes
Hermogenes also was with them, coming again as ambassador from Byzantium
At this point the following event took place
And when they heard this, they were seized with terror, and were at a loss how to deal with the situation
So Cabades set it down plainly that Chosroes should become king over the Persians
The document was written by Mebodes himself, and Cabades immediately passed from among men
So Caoses committed the decision in the matter to the magistrates, supposing that there would be no opposition to him from there
Thus then Chosroes secured the power
Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans
And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns
And when Chosroes saw them, he released the hostages
Then the ambassadors coaxed Chosroes, and spoke many beguiling words most unbecoming to Roman ambassadors
Now the centenarium weighs one hundred pounds, for which reason it is so called for the Romans call one hundred centum
It was decided, accordingly, that Rufinus should be sent concerning them to Byzantium, and that the others should wait until he should return
And it was arranged with Rufinus that seventy days time be allowed until he should arrive
In the meantime, however, a report which was not true reached Persia saying that the Emperor Justinian had become enraged and put Rufinus to death
Chosroes indeed was much perturbed by this, and, already filled with anger, he advanced against the Romans with his whole army
But Rufinus met him on the way as he was returning not far from the city of Nisibis
Therefore they proceeded to this city themselves, and, since they were about to establish the peace, the ambassadors began to convey the money thither
And Chosroes bade him rise from the ground, promising that he would grant all these things
So the ambassadors with the money came to Daras and the Persian army marched back
However, the emperor showed him no disfavour on account of this
And there were many who remained, and many also who returned to their ancestral homes
Thus, then, they concluded the socalled endless peace, when the Emperor Justinian was already in the sixth year of his reign
The Persians also returned Dagaris to the Romans, and received in return for him another man of no mean station
Thus both sides in the manner described made secure the treaty between them
XXIII Straightway it came about that plots were formed against both rulers by their subjects and I shall now explain how this happened
Chosroes, the son of Cabades, was a man of an unruly turn of mind and strangely fond of innovations
For this reason he himself was always full of excitement and alarms, and he was an unfailing cause of similar feelings in all others
So they went to Zames and disclosed their plan, and, urging him on with great enthusiasm, they endeavoured to persuade him to undertake the thing
And since the plan pleased him, they were purposing to assail Chosroes at the fitting moment
But the plan was discovered and came to the knowledge of the king, and thus their proceedings were stopped
Among these was Aspebedes, the brother of Chosroes mother
Cabades, however, the son of Zames, he was quite unable to kill for he was still being reared under the chanaranges, Adergoudounbades
Then the woman, bursting into tears and seizing the knees of her husband, entreated him by no means to kill Cabades
At that time, then, Chosroes and all the others were in ignorance of the fact that the chanaranges had carried this thing through
It was therefore necessary for him to remain there quietly and be cared for, and the king came to that place and saw him
After Adergoudounbades had been removed from the world, Varrames, his son, received the office of chanaranges
And the Emperor Justinian, though in doubt concerning him, received him with great friendliness and honoured him as the grandson of Cabades
So then fared the Persians who rose against Chosroes
Later on Chosroes destroyed also Mebodes for the following reason
While the king was arranging a certain important matter, he directed Zaberganes who was present to call Mebodes
Now it happened that Zaberganes was on hostile terms with Mebodes
Chosroes, therefore, moved with anger, sent one of his attendants commanding Mebodes to go to the tripod
Now as to what this is I shall explain forthwith
There Mebodes sat in pitiable plight for many days, until he was seized and put to death at the command of Chosroes
Such was the final outcome of his good deeds to Chosroes
This, then, is pretty well how matters stand among the people of each and every city
But at this time the officers of the city administration in Byzantium were leading away to death some of the rioters
During this time the emperor and his consort with a few members of the senate shut themselves up in the palace and remained quietly there
For he was most capable in deciding upon what was needful and in finding a solution for difficulties
Such a man then was John
Accordingly the emperor, wishing to win the people to his side, instantly dismissed both these men from office
However, the insurrection continued no less violently under them
When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he inclined still more to his suspicion, and he bade them quit the palace instantly
Thus, then, these two men betook themselves to their homes, and, as long as it was night, they remained there quietly
But on the following day at sunrise it became known to the people that both men had quit the palace where they had been staying
So the whole population ran to them, and they declared Hypatius emperor and prepared to lead him to the marketplace to assume the power
Now war and royal power are agreed to be the greatest of all things in the world
For those things whose issue is most quickly decided, fall, as a rule, under the sway of fortune
So spoke Origenes
But some say that he came there purposely, being welldisposed toward the emperor
And many opinions were expressed favouring either course
My opinion then is that the present time, above all others, is inopportune for flight, even though it bring safety
If, now, it is your wish to save yourself, O Emperor, there is no difficulty
For we have much money, and there is the sea, here the boats
However consider whether it will not come about after you have been saved that you would gladly exchange that safety for death
For as for myself, I approve a certain ancient saying that royalty is a good burialshroud
And from the palace Mundus went out through the gate which, from the circling descent, has been given the name of the Snail
The emperor therefore commanded him to go to the socalled Bronze Gate and the propylaea there
Then indeed from both sides the partisans of Hypatius were assailed with might and main and destroyed
And there perished among the populace on that day more than thirty thousand
But the emperor commanded the two prisoners to be kept in severe confinement
And the soldiers killed both of them on the following day and threw their bodies into the sea
This was the end of the insurrection in Byzantium
XXV Tribunianus and John were thus deprived of office, but at a later time they were both restored to the same positions
And Tribunianus lived on in office many years and died of disease, suffering no further harm from anyone
The Empress Theodora hated him above all others
And when John learned of the purpose of the queen regarding him, he was greatly terrified
But in his rascality and the lawlessness of his conduct there was no moderation or abatement
And it was on him that the hope of the Romans centred as he marched once more against the Persians, leaving his wife in Byzantium
Now if your father were willing, we should most easily organize this project and accomplish whatever God wills
In saying this she seemed to John to speak well, and a certain day was appointed to carry out the plan
So these departed for this task
But in the natural confusion which resulted the bodyguards of John for they stood close by came immediately to his side
But God, I think, did not suffer Johns retribution to end thus, but prepared for him a greater punishment
And it fell out thus
Now it happened that John had become especially hostile to Eusebius, and hence the suspicion of the plot fell upon him
Accordingly men were sent from the senate to investigate this act of pollution
Thus begging everywhere along the way he was conveyed to the city of Antinous in Aegypt
And this is now the third year during which they have been guarding him there in confinement
Thus then John the Cappadocian ten years afterward was overtaken by this punishment for his political career
So then Justinian made a present of money to Chosroes, and not long afterwards dismissed the envoys
In the city of Daras the following event took place
Then he established himself in a palace as if in a citadel, and was strengthening his tyranny every day
But as it was, this was prevented by the agreement which had already been reached, as I have said
And first at the door of the courtyard they found some few of the bodyguards, whom they slew immediately
Such, then, was the progress of events touching this tyranny

And he conferred with Alamoundaras concerning this matter and commanded him to provide causes for war
And this was true
For no mention of Saracens was ever made in treaties, on the ground that they were included under the names of Persians and Romans
This Summus was the brother of Julian, who not long before had served as envoy to the Aethiopians and Homeritae
The Emperor Justinian, therefore, took the matter under consideration, and a long time was spent in the settlement of the question
This letter he asserted to have been put into his hands by the Huns themselves who had come before him
So then Chosroes, with these charges against the Romans, was purposing to break off the treaty
But as to whether he was speaking the truth in these matters, I am not able to say
For inasmuch as they were at peace, they were not keeping a strict guard over that region
Use, therefore, this good chance while the time fits, lest thou seek for it after it has ceased
For when once the time of opportunity has passed, it is not its nature to return again
When Chosroes heard this, it seemed to him that Vittigis advised well, and he was still more eager to break off the treaty
But because he wished the thing he willingly consented to be persuaded
For these accusations one might make also against Cyrus, the King of the Persians, and Alexander, the Macedonian
But justice is never accustomed to dwell together with envy
For these reasons, then, Chosroes was purposing to break off the treaty
III At this same time another event also occurred it was as follows
And becoming master of these places, he was plotted against and murdered by those who had formerly possessed them
After this crime had been committed, the perpetrators of the murder fled into the land of Persia
They were two brothers, sons of Perozes
And when the Emperor heard this, he gave over the villages to Amazaspes, the nephew of Symeon, and appointed him ruler over the Armenians
After telling this, Acacius, by the emperors will, slew Amazaspes treacherously, and himself secured the command over the Armenians by the gift of the emperor
For he plundered their property without excuse and ordained that they should pay an unheardof tax of four centenaria
But the Armenians, unable to bear him any longer, conspired together and slew Acacius and fled for refuge to Pharangium
Therefore the emperor sent Sittas against them from Byzantium
For Sittas had been delaying there since the time when the treaty was made with the Persians
And the tribe called the Aspetiani, great in power and in numbers, was willing to join him
But by some chance those who carried the tablets went by another road and did not succeed at all in meeting the Aspetiani
But they, being now possessed with anger, arrayed themselves for battle with all the rest
Both parties were horsemen
For it happened that he had no helmet on his head
Thus it did not escape the enemy that he had come there with only a few men
But some say that Sittas did not die at the hand of Artabanes, but that Solomon, a very insignificant man among the Armenians, destroyed him
Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes nor were they willing to receive his proposals
Bassaces, the soninlaw, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly
Now we shall begin our account from a little distance back in order that you may be able to follow the whole course of events
And this thou thyself shalt know at no distant time, as soon as he is able to subdue completely the people of the West
We omit to speak of the fate of the Libyans and of the Italians
The whole earth is not large enough for the man it is too small a thing for him to conquer all the world together
But he is even looking about the heavens and is searching the retreats beyond the ocean, wishing to gain for himself some other world
But the chief thing has not yet been spoken
The peace, therefore, as far as concerns him, has already been broken for thee, and he himself has set an end to the endless peace
For the crime has been committed by him who attempts it, even though success be lacking
Now as for the course which the war will follow, this is surely clear to everyone
Nay more, the contest will not be evenly matched for us even in point of strength
For disregarding his master, he has remained in the West, holding the power of Italy himself
For it was the late autumn season, in the thirteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian
At that time also the comet appeared, at first about as long as a tall man, but later much larger
And the end of it was toward the west and its beginning toward the east, and it followed behind the sun itself
For the sun was in Capricorn and it was in Sagittarius
For from the Ionian Gulf these barbarians plundered everything in order as far as the suburbs of Byzantium
And taking with them the money and leading away one hundred and twenty thousand captives, they all retired homeward without encountering any opposition
In later times too they often came there and brought upon the Romans irreparable calamity
In this way they destroyed almost all the Greeks except the Peloponnesians, and then withdrew
Belisarius, after humbling Vittigis, the king of the Goths and Italians, brought him alive to Byzantium
And I shall now proceed to tell how the army of the Persians invaded the land of the Romans
When the Emperor Justinian perceived that Chosroes was eager for war, he wished to offer him some counsel and to dissuade him from the undertaking
But when they have brought about war according to their intention, to return again to peace is for men, I think, not easy
For the crimes of those who have done wrong are made manifest to their neighbours by their acts, not by their thoughts
But this would not seem to be becoming even to ordinary men, much less to kings
When Chosroes saw this message, he neither made any immediate answer nor did he dismiss Anastasius, but he compelled him to remain there
But he did not enter by the country between the rivers, but advanced with the Euphrates on his right
And a long second wall outside the fortress cuts off the land between the two rivers, and completes the form of a triangle around Circesium
But meeting with no success, he hastened his march forward
There it happened that the horse on which Chosroes was riding neighed and stamped the ground with his foot
And the Magi considered the meaning of this incident and announced that the place would be captured
Chosroes then made camp and led his army against the fortifications to assail the wall
And the guards pushed and struggled still more, but were quite unable to get the gate back to the threshold
On the other hand they dared not open it again, since they perceived that it was held by the enemy
But some say that it was not a stone but a block of wood which the Persians threw into the gateway
Then he dismissed Anastasius, bidding him announce to the Emperor Justinian where in the world he had left Chosroes, son of Cabades
But the bishop, alleging that he had no money, refused absolutely to undertake the matter
And after setting down these things in writing, Candidus received all the inhabitants of Sura
And some few among them survived, but the majority, unable to support the misery which had fallen to their lot, succumbed soon afterwards
After the settlement of this affair Chosroes led his army forward
How great, now, the army of Chosroes is you are assuredly informed
So spoke Bouzes and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing
For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off
And where in the world he was neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn
Such, then, was the course of these events
But to the architects of public buildings it seemed that neither one of these things should be done
Germanus, though disappointed in this plan, had some hope at first because he expected an army from Byzantium
He therefore threatened to destroy all the Syrians and Cilicians, and bidding Megas follow him, he led his army to Hierapolis
This city lies between Antioch and Hierapolis, at a distance from both of twodays journey for an unencumbered traveller
And so on the fourth day he reached Antioch, while the Persians came to the suburb of Beroea
And he commanded them to set ladders against the wall and to make trial of mounting it, and they did as directed
By this time the king was furious with anger and he fired nearly the whole city
He then mounted the acropolis and decided to storm the fortress
Such, then, was the situation of the Beroeans
Megas, upon reaching Antioch and announcing the terms arranged by him with Chosroes, failed utterly to persuade them to carry out this agreement
For it happened that the Emperor Justinian had sent John, the son of Rufinus, and Julian, his private secretary, as ambassadors to Chosroes
The person holding this office is styled a secretis by the Romans for secrets they are accustomed to call secreta
These men had reached Antioch and were remaining there
For this reason Megas returned unsuccessful
But Ephraemius, the bishop of Antioch, fearing the attack of the Persians, went into Cilicia
There too came Germanus not long afterwards, taking with him some few men but leaving the most of them in Antioch
For to pay a thing which one does not possess could not be made possible for a man by any device
Let this, then, be my defence for the moment in behalf of these men
But if I should be able to have converse with the sufferers, I should have something else also to say which has now escaped me
So spoke Megas, and Chosroes permitted him to go into the acropolis
Moved by the tearful entreaties of the man Chosroes fulfilled his request, and binding himself by an oath, gave pledges to all on the acropolis
Then the Beroeans, after coming into such great danger, left the acropolis free from harm, and departing went each his own way
VIII June A
Some of the population of Antioch thereupon departed from there with their money and fled as each one could
Not long after this the Persian army also came
There they all pitched their tents and made camp fronting on the River Orontes and not very far from the stream
On account of this Chosroes, boiling with anger, decided to storm the wall
For at this place, as has been stated by me above, the wall of fortification was most vulnerable
Thereupon the Romans, since the structure on which they were to stand when fighting was very narrow, devised the following remedy
So the Persians, pressing on most vigorously from all sides, were sending their arrows thickly everywhere, and especially along the crest of the hill
Meanwhile the Romans were fighting them back with all their strength, not soldiers alone, but also many of the most courageous youths of the populace
But it appeared that those who were attacking the wall there were engaged in a battle on even terms with their enemy
But the Persians, with no one opposing them, set ladders against the wall and mounted with no difficulty
But some say that it was by the will of Chosroes that the Persians hesitated
For this reason too the Persians also made signs to the fugitives with their hands, urging them to flee as quickly as possible
Some of them were in heavy armour, but the majority were unarmed and using only stones as missiles
And pushing back the enemy they raised the paean, and with shouts proclaimed the Emperor Justinian triumphant, as if they had won the victory
At this point Chosroes, seated on the tower which is on the height, summoned the ambassadors, wishing to say something
For already the Persians had forced back the citizens by their numbers and turned them to flight, and a great slaughter took place there
For the Persians did not spare persons of any age and were slaying all whom they met, old and young alike
Thus the inhabitants of Antioch were visited with every form of misfortune
For to trample upon captives is not holy
But as for these matters, let them be as God wishes
When he had finished these things, he gave orders to the Persians to burn the whole city
And the ambassadors begged him to withhold his hand only from the church, for which he had carried away ransom in abundance
This man, Tatianus by name, was an especially discreet person, a native of Mopsuestia
The barbarians burned also the parts outside the fortifications, except the sanctuary which is dedicated to St
Julianus and the houses which stand about this sanctuary
For it happened that the ambassadors had taken up their lodgings there
As for the fortifications, the Persians left them wholly untouched
For he who submits to be worsted in evil things would in better things justly be victorious
So spoke the ambassadors
For friendship, he said, which is made by men on terms of money is generally spent as fast as the money is used up
It was necessary, therefore, that the Romans should pay some definite annual sum to the Persians
So, said the ambassadors, the Persians desire to have the Romans subject and tributary to themselves
This man, seeing one of the young men of Antioch on foot and alone concealing himself there, separated from the others and pursued him
Now the young man was a butcher, Aeimachus by name
And the rider fell immediately to the ground, whereupon the youth drew out his sword and slew him
Such, then, was the course of these events
But Chosroes with his whole army proceeded on the way to Apamea
And he did as they requested
Then indeed it befell that a sight surpassing both description and belief was there seen
Then upon learning that the army of the enemy had come close to the city, he went in great haste to Chosroes
Therefore, said Chosroes, receive me into the city accompanied by a few men with all the gates opened wide
And the priest said Yes, for I have come here to invite thee to do this very thing
So the whole army pitched their tents and made camp before the fortifications
Then Chosroes chose out two hundred of the best of the Persians and entered the city
But God, as has been said, preserved Apamea
So spoke the priest
And Chosroes yielded and fulfilled the request
And he himself went up there also, eager to be a spectator of the performances
And he was followed in the same tracks by the wearer of the green colour
At that time one of the citizens of Apamea came before Chosroes and accused a Persian of entering his house and violating his maiden daughter
Upon hearing this, Chosroes, boiling with anger, commanded that the man should be brought
And when he came before him, he directed that he should be impaled in the camp
And Chosroes promised that he would release the man to them, but he secretly impaled him not long afterwards
So after these things had been thus accomplished, he departed and marched back with the whole army
And those who were left behind returned to their native land as each one could
Then a sort of ambition came over Chosroes to capture the city of Edessa
There was a certain Augarus in early times, toparch of Edessa for thus the kings of the different nations were called then
A long time, therefore, was consumed by him in this visit
So the attendants did as he directed
And Augustus looked upon the performance carefully for a very long time, and he was wondering that nature untaught makes animals miss their native land
And when Augarus had secured this, he begged of Augustus to build him a hippodrome in the city of Edessa
And he granted also this
Thus then Augarus departed from Rome and came to Edessa
And the citizens enquired of him whether he had come bringing any good thing for them from the Emperor Augustus
At a later time when Augarus was well advanced in years, he was seized with an exceedingly violent attack of gout
And they say that he added this also that never would the city be liable to capture by the barbarians
The city did in fact come under the Medes a short time afterwards, not by capture however, but in the following manner
he is eager to attach it to his cause, judging by what has happened in my time, which I shall present in the appropriate place
As for these things, then, let them be as God wills, and so let them be told
For this reason it seemed to Chosroes at that time a matter of moment to capture Edessa
When with difficulty Chosroes reached the neighbourhood of Edessa, they say that suppuration set in in his face and his jaw became swollen
For this reason he was quite unwilling to make an attempt on the city, but he sent Paulus and demanded money from the citizens
And Chosroes took the money and kept the agreement
And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheardof zeal
And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing
For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain
Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives
But when, likewise, the citizens of Constantina offered money, he accepted it, although he asserted that the city belonged to him from his fathers
For at the time when Cabades took Amida, he wished also to capture Edessa and Constantina
And when Cabades heard this, he was convinced and led his army on to Constantina
And upon arriving there, he issued orders to the whole army to encamp for a siege
For this reason it was that Chosroes claimed that the city belonged to him from his fathers
However no one of the barbarians dared to get inside
Next he decided to make a tunnel secretly at the eastern side of the city
For at this point alone can the earth be dug, since the other parts of the fortifications were set upon rock by the builders
So the Persians began to dig, beginning from their trench
Then he told them of everything and commanded them all to be on the watch and to take all possible care for their safety
The Persians, on the other hand, not knowing what was being done, were pushing on the work no less than before
And the first of them the Romans killed, while those in the rear by fleeing at top speed into the camp saved themselves
For the Romans decided by no means to pursue them in the dark
Such were the fortunes of the Romans during the first invasion of Chosroes and the summer drew to its close
For he brought with him charioteers and musicians both from Antioch and from the other Roman cities
Thus, then, the portent which had come to the citizens of Antioch in the reign of Anastasius reached this final fulfilment for them
And finally in this capture the whole city, as has been said, was destroyed
Such, then, was the calamity which befell the men of Antioch
For Martinus had been sent immediately to the East, and for this reason Chosroes found him at Daras, as has been stated above
And among the Goths, Vittigis remained in Byzantium, but all the rest marched with Belisarius against Chosroes
Such, then, was the course of these events
And Belisarius and his followers went in haste, since he was eager to anticipate Chosroes making any second invasion into the land of the Romans
XV But in the meantime Chosroes was leading his army against Colchis, where the Lazi were calling him in for the following reason
And since his owner showed him great kindness, he attended the school of a grammatist
This man unsettled and threw into confusion all the relations of the Romans and the Lazi
And now we and the king of Lazica give to the Persians both ourselves and our land to treat in any way you may desire
But it is worth while to tell a few of the things which the accursed Romans have dared to do against us
For there is no obstacle between
So spoke the envoys
And they promised that they themselves would be guides of the route, and would take the lead in this work for the Persians
And Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with his whole army
For war is wont to succeed by reason of careful planning more than by anything else
Now it is necessary that those who gather for deliberation should make their minds entirely free from modesty and from fear
Thus spoke Belisarius
And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation against the enemys country
And their opinion was followed immediately by the whole council
Agreeing, therefore, to release both of them with their followers within sixty days, he commanded them also to follow with the rest of the army
So Belisarius was making his preparation for the invasion with great zeal
For this reason they closed in still more around the fortifications, so as to set up ladders immediately, since no one was defending the wall
And neither seeing nor hearing anything of the enemy, they sent to Chosroes and explained the situation
And Chosroes, filled with rage, impaled Aniabedes, since he had been outgeneralled by John, a tradesman and an altogether unwarlike man
But some say that not Aniabedes, but the officer commanding the men who were working the ram was impaled
And he himself broke camp with the whole army, and coming close to the fortifications of Petra, made camp and began a siege
And bringing up the whole army there, he opened the action, commanding all to shoot with their bows against the parapet
The Romans, meanwhile, in defending themselves, made use of their engines of war and all their bows
And it has only one approach on the level ground, and that not very broad for exceedingly high cliffs overhang it on either side
And they built two towers, one in each of these walls, not following the customary plan, but as follows
Such, then, are the fortifications of Petra
Thus Chosroes captured Petra
And there he gave orders to make a camp at about fortytwo stades from the city of Nisibis
But all the others marvelled greatly that he did not wish to camp close to the fortifications, and some were quite unwilling to follow him
Belisarius therefore addressed those of the officers who were about him thus It was not my wish to disclose to all what I am thinking
For talk carried about through a camp cannot keep secrets, for it advances little by little until it is carried out even to the enemy
And the proof of this you have near at hand
If, therefore, the conflict should be close by the city, the struggle will not be even for us and the Persians
But if the enemy engage with us here and we conquer them, I have great hopes, fellow officers, of capturing the city
When Belisarius had said this, all the others except Peter were convinced, and they made camp and remained with him
And when this was observed by Nabedes, he led the Persian army running at full speed against them
And the Romans together with the Goths followed them up and slew a hundred and fifty men
For the pursuit was only of short duration, and the others quickly got inside the fortifications
Accordingly he broke camp and moved forward with the whole army
And after accomplishing a days journey, they came upon a fortress which the Persians call Sisauranon
For the wall happened to be extremely strong, and the barbarians defended it against their assailants with the greatest vigour
Now exactly this has happened to us in the present case
For stupid daring leads to destruction, but discreet hesitation is well adapted always to save those who adopt such a course
Let us therefore establish ourselves here and endeavour to capture this fortress, and let Arethas with his forces be sent into the country of Assyria
For the Saracens are by nature unable to storm a wall, but the cleverest of all men at plundering
These words of Belisarius seemed to all well spoken, and he straightway put the plan into execution
So Arethas and his men crossed the River Tigris and entered Assyria
And since a great number of persons had taken refuge suddenly in the fortress, they were naturally hard pressed by the want of provisions
And the emperor not long afterwards sent these Persians and Bleschames to Italy to fight against the Goths
Such, then, was the course of events which had to do with the fortress of Sisauranon
But Arethas, fearing lest he should be despoiled of his booty by the Romans, was now unwilling to return to the camp
For this reason, then, he advised Trajan and John to return by another route to the land of the Romans
But Belisarius and the Roman army, hearing nothing concerning this force, were disturbed, and they were filled with fear and an intolerable and exaggerated suspicion
Belisarius therefore called together all the officers and opened a discussion
And this reputation has come to prevail not alone among the Romans, but also among all barbarians
For I would have you look thus at the situation of this army
For as for going forward, I consider it impossible even to be spoken of
So spoke John, and all the others expressed approval, and becoming disorderly, they demanded that the retreat be made with all speed
Accordingly Belisarius laid the sick in the carts and let them lead the way, while he led the army behind them
So ended the invasion of the Romans
Such, then, were the events which took place in the second invasion of Chosroes
And Belisarius went to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor, and passed the winter there
And Candidus entreated him to send men to Sergiopolis to take all the treasures of the sanctuary there
And when Chosroes followed this suggestion, Candidus sent some of his followers with them
But Chosroes said that these were by no means sufficient for him, and demanded that he should receive others still more than these
Accordingly he sent men, ostensibly to search out with all diligence the wealth of the city, but in reality to take possession of the city
Thus those who were sent by Chosroes returned to him unsuccessful, and he, boiling with anger, began to make plans to capture the city
He accordingly sent an army of six thousand, commanding them to begin a siege and to make assaults upon the fortifications
For, as it happened, they had not more than two hundred soldiers
However, Chosroes never released Candidus
For it was necessary, I suppose, that since he had disregarded his sworn agreement, he should be a priest no longer
Such, then, was the course of these events
And his purpose was to lead the army straight for Palestine, in order that he might plunder all their treasures and especially those in Jerusalem
For he had it from hearsay that this was an especially goodly land and peopled by wealthy inhabitants
The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them
Such was the message of the letter
But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates
For this would justly be called not salvation but treason
But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits
When Belisarius learned this, he did as follows
And these men did as directed
And he arranged the soldiers as follows
On either side of the tent were Thracians and Illyrians, with Goths beyond them, and next to these Eruli, and finally Vandals and Moors
And their line extended for a great distance over the plain
And each one had his horsewhip, but for weapons one had a sword, another an axe, another an uncovered bow
And all gave the impression that they were eager to be off on the hunt with never a thought of anything else
But he first comes into the midst of the Romans, and then begins to offer suggestions concerning peace
With such words as these he dismissed the ambassador
And when Abandanes came to Chosroes, he advised him to take his departure with all possible speed
Chosroes was convinced by this admonition and wished to turn back to his own country, but he found himself in a very perplexing situation
Now Belisarius knew well that not even a hundred thousand men would ever be sufficient to check the crossing of Chosroes
For this reason he commanded Diogenes and Adolius to remain quiet
Chosroes, accordingly, constructed a bridge with great celerity and crossed the River Euphrates suddenly with his whole army
Then Belisarius also with the whole Roman army crossed the River Euphrates and immediately sent to Chosroes
And they asked of him that he treat the Romans as his friends in his journey through their land
But in the meantime Chosroes, disregarding the agreement, took the city of Callinicus which was entirely without defenders
And it happened that great numbers of farmers had gathered there
These Chosroes enslaved and razed everything to the ground
A little later, upon receiving the hostage, John, he retired to his own country
And the Armenians who had submitted to Chosroes received pledges from the Romans and came with Bassaces to Byzantium
Such was the fortune of the Romans in the third invasion of Chosroes
During these times there was a pestilence, by which the whole human race came near to being annihilated
And it attacked some in the summer season, others in the winter, and still others at the other times of the year
It started from the Aegyptians who dwell in Pelusium
And this disease always took its start from the coast, and from there went up to the interior
And in the second year it reached Byzantium in the middle of spring, where it happened that I was staying at that time
And it came as follows
And they were taken in the following manner
It was natural, therefore, that not one of those who had contracted the disease expected to die from it
Up to this point, then, everything went in about the same way with all who had taken the disease
For there ensued with some a deep coma, with others a violent delirium, and in either case they suffered the characteristic symptoms of the disease
For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot all those who were familiar to them and seemed to be sleeping constantly
And if anyone cared for them, they would eat without waking, but some also were neglected, and these would die directly through lack of sustenance
And those who were attending them were in a state of constant exhaustion and had a most difficult time of it throughout
They had also great difficulty in the matter of eating, for they could not easily take food
And upon opening some of the swellings, they found a strange sort of carbuncle that had grown inside them
With many also a vomiting of blood ensued without visible cause and straightway brought death
For example, while some were helped by bathing, others were harmed in no less degree
And of those who received no care many died, but others, contrary to reason, were saved
And again, methods of treatment shewed different results with different patients
And in the case of women who were pregnant death could be certainly foreseen if they were taken with the disease
For some died through miscarriage, but others perished immediately at the time of birth with the infants they bore
With others who survived the tongue did not remain unaffected, and they lived on either lisping or speaking incoherently and with difficulty
XXIII Now the disease in Byzantium ran a course of four months, and its greatest virulence lasted about three
For this reason it came about that some of the notable men of the city because of the universal destitution remained unburied for many days
And it fell to the lot of the emperor, as was natural, to make provision for the trouble
In the Latin tongue the Romans designate this office by the term referendarius
So those who had not as yet fallen into complete destitution in their domestic affairs attended individually to the burial of those connected with them
At that time all the customary rites of burial were overlooked
But these things were displayed to the world in later times
And if one did succeed in meeting a man going out, he was carrying one of the dead
Indeed in a city which was simply abounding in all good things starvation almost absolute was running riot
Such was the course of the pestilence in the Roman empire at large as well as in Byzantium
And it fell also upon the land of the Persians and visited all the other barbarians besides
In that place is the great sanctuary of fire, which the Persians reverence above all other gods
This is the fire which the Romans worshipped under the name of Hestia in ancient times
And Chosroes remained quiet expecting these men
For he knew well that no one of the enemy would stand in their way
And he commanded them to gather all in one place and so make their invasion into Persarmenia
When the commanders received these letters, all of them together with their followers began to gather into the land of Armenia
This fortress is separated from Theodosiopolis by a journey of four days
There too Peter came not long afterwards together with Adolius and some other commanders
Now the troops in this region were commanded by Isaac, the brother of Narses
And Philemouth and Beros with the Eruli who were under them came into the territory of Chorzianene, not far from the camp of Martinus
Thus then were encamped the Roman commanders with their troops and the whole army amounted to thirty thousand men
Now all these troops were neither gathered into one place, nor indeed was there any general meeting for conference
But the generals sent to each other some of their followers and began to make enquiries concerning the invasion
Suddenly, however, Peter, without communicating with anyone, and without any careful consideration, invaded the hostile land with his troops
And when on the following day this was found out by Philemouth and Beros, the leaders of the Eruli, they straightway followed
And when this in turn came to the knowledge of Martinus and Valerianus and their men, they quickly joined in the invasion
As for the others, they proceeded in a body straight for Doubios, neither plundering nor damaging in any other way the land of the Persians
And the priest of the Christians is called Catholicos in the Greek tongue, because he presides alone over the whole region
So Nabedes with stones and carts blocked up the entrances into the village and thus made it still more difficult of access
And he asserted that the man had retired from Anglon with the whole Median army
And when Narses heard this, he was indignant, and he heaped reproaches and abuse upon his fellowcommanders for their hesitation
For the soldiers marched forward, mixed in with the baggage train, as if going to the ready plunder of great wealth
But when they came near to Anglon, they sent out spies who returned to them announcing the array of the enemy
Now Peter held the right wing and Valerianus the left, while Martinus and his men arrayed themselves in the centre
And when they came close to their opponents, they halted, preserving their formation, but not without disorder
And then Narses urged his men forward and pressed still harder upon the enemy, and the rest of the Romans joined in the action
And his brother Isaac carried him out from among the fighting men, mortally wounded
And he died shortly afterwards, having proved himself a brave man in this engagement
Then, as was to be expected, great confusion fell upon the Roman army, and Nabedes let out the whole Persian force upon his opponents
Such is the custom of the Eruli
And this proved a disaster for the Romans so great as to exceed anything that had ever befallen them previously
For great numbers of them perished and still more fell into the hands of the enemy
As for the forces of Justus and Peranius, they invaded the country about Taraunon, and after gathering some little plunder, immediately returned
And in the following year, Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the fourth time invaded the land of the Romans, leading his army towards Mesopotamia
So the barbarians were already laying hold of the sheep, and the shepherds were trying most valiantly to prevent them
Now one of the Huns who was fighting before the others was making more trouble for the Romans than all the rest
So the Romans went inside the fortifications, while the barbarians pitched their tents and made camp in a body about seven stades from the city
Accordingly he decided to sell his withdrawal to the citizens of Edessa for a great sum of money
And they with all speed chose out four of their illustrious men and sent them
And the envoys said that they would give as much as they had provided before, when he came against them after capturing Antioch
And Zaberganes dismissed them with laughter, telling them to deliberate most carefully concerning their safety and then to come again to the Persians
For there was never a war whose outcome might be taken for granted by those who waged it
Thereupon Chosroes in anger commanded the envoys to be gone with all speed
From that time on, however, the barbarians kept a careful guard, and there was no further opportunity for anyone to go out against them
Wherefore the barbarians devised the following plan
And yet least of all cities should Edessa suffer any adversity at thy hand
For men, as a general thing, bring down upon their own heads the most of the misfortunes which are going to befall them
Such were the words of Stephanus
Such then were the words which Chosroes hurled forth, being in hopes of capturing Edessa with no trouble
And the ambassadors since all the conditions which he had announced to them seemed impossible, in despair and great vexation, proceeded to the city
And when they had come inside the citywall, they reported the message from Chosroes, and the whole city was filled with tumult and lamentation
Now the artificial hill was rising to a great height and was being pushed forward with much haste
And the Romans, being at a loss what to do, again sent off the envoys to Chosroes
At first, then, the Romans tried to overtop the wall opposite the hill by means of another structure
He then came up close to the enemys camp and began to converse with some of the Persian commanders
By this means they were planning to burn the embankment
Accordingly the Romans straightway set fire to the treetrunks which had been prepared for this purpose
But they kept throwing fresh wood into the pit, not slackening their efforts for a moment
But since the trouble increased, the barbarians rushed up to help in great numbers, and the Romans, shooting them from the wall, killed many
Then even the flames rose and appeared clearly above the embankment, and the Persians abandoned this undertaking
But Chosroes about midday sent a large part of the army against the socalled Great Gate in order to storm the wall
Now it was already some days since Rhecinarius had arrived at the camp of the barbarians
And Chosroes, suspecting that the reason was not a sound one, prepared for battle
Such, then, was the purpose of Chosroes in arranging the army in this way
And the fighting began early in the morning, and at first the Persians had the advantage
Meanwhile the women and children, and the aged also, were gathering stones for the fighters and assisting them in other ways
But Chosroes, in a passion of anger, drove them all on with threats and urged them forward against the enemy
Only Azarethes at the socalled Soinian Gate was still fighting with his men, at the place which they call Tripurgia
Then the Emperor Justinian sent Constantianus and Sergius a second time to Chosroes to arrange the truce
These two towns are separated by the Tigris River only, for they have nothing else between them
When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he immediately sent both Tribunus and the money, amounting to twenty centenaria
And Arethas came within a little of capturing alive two of the sons of Alamoundaras however, he did not actually succeed
Such, then, was the course of events among the Saracens
For in the third year of the truce he devised the following schemes
For he considered that, as regards the barbarians dwelling in the Caucasus, Lazica was nothing else than a bulwark against them
For these reasons, then, Chosroes was anxious to gain possession of Lazica, but in the Lazi he had not the least confidence
For since the time when the Romans had withdrawn from Lazica, the common people of the country naturally found the Persian rule burdensome
For the Persians are beyond all other men singular in their ways, and they are excessively rigid as regards the routine of daily life
And their laws are difficult of access for all men, and their requirements quite unbearable
And apart from this, salt is produced nowhere in Lazica, nor indeed does grain grow there nor the vine nor any other good thing
When, therefore, Chosroes perceived this, he was eager to anticipate with certainty any move on their part to revolt against him
But George, paying no heed to him in his fury, saved the city for the Romans
For he received Isdigousnas into the city with only twenty men
For no one ever saw an interpreter become a tablecompanion of even one of the more humble officials, not to speak of a king
So the plot against the city of Daras ended in this way for Chosroes
XXIX His first move against Lazica was as follows
Now when this lumber had been conveyed to Lazica, it happened that it was struck suddenly by lightning and reduced to ashes
But Pharsanses secretly revealed to Goubazes what was being prepared
He, accordingly, did not come to Phabrizus at all, but began openly to plan a revolt
For if left by themselves the Colchians would not be able to repel the power of the Persians
And Chosroes, being greatly disturbed by these things, dispatched a great army of horse and foot against the besiegers, putting Mermeroes in command of them
And when Goubazes learned of this, he considered the matter together with Dagisthaeus and acted in the manner which I shall presently set forth
The river Boas rises close to the territory of the Tzani among the Armenians who dwell around Pharangium
Moreover there are two cities of the greatest importance in that region, Rhodopolis and Mocheresis
Adjoining this land is the home of the Romans who are called Pontic
And yet Lazica is everywhere difficult to traverse both to the right and to the left of the River Phasis
For there are on both sides of the river exceedingly high and jagged mountains, and as a result the passes are narrow and very long
The Romans call the roads through such passes clisurae when they put their own word into a Greek form
But since at that time Lazica happened to be unguarded, the Persians had reached Petra very easily with the Lazi who were their guides
And Goubazes had promised that the emperor would give them this money
So Goubazes was thus engaged
But Dagisthaeus, being a rather young man and by no means competent to carry on a war against Persia, did not handle the situation properly
He himself, moreover, though besieging Petra with the whole army, accomplished nothing, although the enemy were few
But this was not sufficient greatly to disturb the Romans
And since the Romans were accomplishing nothing by assaulting the wall, they again turned to digging
Such, then, was the course of events in the Roman camp
XXX But Mermeroes, after passing the Iberian frontier with the whole Median army, was moving forward with the River Phasis on his right
For he was quite unwilling to go through the country of Lazica, lest any obstacle should confront him there
In this way he succeeded in deceiving him so that the Roman army did not immediately enter the city
So the Persians fled inside their fortifications, and the Tzani, after plundering the Roman camp proceeded straight for Rhizaeum
And from there they came to Athens and betook themselves to their homes through the territory of the Trapezuntines
Thus, then, Mermeroes with the Median army departed from there
For in depth this river is not inferior to the deepest rivers, and it spreads out to a great width
Indeed, those who navigate in those parts are able to draw up drinking water in the midst of the sea
And it happened that long before this time he had sent another considerable army also to Lazica, which had not yet arrived there
The commander of this army was Rhecithancus, from Thrace, a man of discretion and a capable warrior
Such then was the course of these events
Now when Mermeroes got into the mountains, as I have said, he was anxious to fill Petra with provisions from there
He therefore selected five thousand men and left them there, appointing as commanders over them Phabrizus and three others
For it seemed to him unnecessary to leave more men there, since there was no enemy at all
And he himself with the rest of the army came into Persarmenia and remained quietly in the country around Doubios
And pursuing them for a very great distance they came well into Iberia
There they happened upon certain others of the Persians also and slew a great number
And John the Cappadocian one year before this came to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor
For at that time the Empress Theodora had reached the term of her life
Now there was a certain priest in Byzantium, Augustus by name, who guarded the treasures of the temple of Sophia

The general tendency has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer
It may have been much longer than that

FOSSIL TRILOBITE SLIGHTLY MAGNIFIED FOSSIL TRILOBITE SLIGHTLY MAGNIFIED Photo John J
None of these creatures were of very great size
Among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in length
No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth
Life grew and grows
Life consists of individuals
They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can reproduce themselves
They eat and they breed
FOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK FOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK Nat
That early world was a world of strong tides and currents
But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history
We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions
For long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life
These were the first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first known Vertebrata
None of these were excessively big by our present standards
We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes
They do not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them
V THE AGE OF THE COAL SWAMPS The land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless
Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain
Life was still only in the sea
Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate
The causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they have still to be properly estimated
There have been high and deep ages in the worlds history and low and level ages
After that much cooling had been achieved, the internal temperature ceased to affect surface conditions
But now came their opportunity
And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms
SKULL OF A LABYRINTHODONT, CAPITOSAURUS SKULL OF A LABYRINTHODONT, CAPITOSAURUS Nat
Some of the earlier insects were very large
There were dragon flies in this period with wings that spread out to twentynine inches
In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathing air
All except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the passage of the ear and eardrum
SKELETON OF A LABYRINTHODONT THE ERYOPS SKELETON OF A LABYRINTHODONT THE ERYOPS Nat
All the airbreathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged to the class amphibia
They all had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, if they were to germinate
All living things, plants and animals alike, are primarily water things
The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an eardrum
Thus far life had now extended
The hills and high lands were still quite barren and lifeless
The temperature of the world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold
Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase
These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles
There was a great number of ferns
And there was now also an increased variety of insects
There were beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet to come
This new land life needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail
Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came
The period lasted altogether, it is now supposed, upwards of two hundred million years
It came to an end some eighty million years ago
In the world today the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and their distribution is very limited
We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises the Chelonia, the alligators and crocodiles, and the lizards
It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora
It endured no frosts
A PTERODACTYL A PTERODACTYL Nat
There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs
Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs of a corresponding size
These were the Pterodactyls
Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters
Some of these again approached the proportions of our present whales
Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age
It was by our human standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it
In the seas there had been no such advance but a great proliferation of new forms of life
They had had predecessors in the Palozoic seas, but now was their age of glory
So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were otherwise uninhabited
Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs
Most reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and season to hatch
In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings
Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic times
And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any sign of a mammal
Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive
And even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them
Most but not all mammals today have mamm and suckle their young
Both birds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic times
That run of luck for life was running out
The Ammonites for example in these last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of fantastic forms
There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent several million years
There is a veil here still, over even the outline of the history of life
In all their stupendous variety they have died out and left no descendants
The cold has killed them
All their final variations were insufficient they had never hit upon survival conditions
The map of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map of today
At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was austere
But this would be an altogether superficial comparison
The differences between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are far profounder than the resemblances
With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone
Its life is that of an isolated individual
A teachable type of life had come into the world
For instance we find at a comparatively early stage that rhinoceroslike beasts appear
There is a creature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the earliest division of this period
It was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs
But its brain capacity was not one tenth that of its living successor
This is something that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals

We can in consequence establish relations with almost all sorts of them
When they suffer they utter cries and make movements that rouse our feelings
We can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition
They can be tamed to selfrestraint towards us, domesticated and taught
COMPARATIVE SIZES OF BRAINS OF RHINOCEROS AND DINOCERAS COMPARATIVE SIZES OF BRAINS OF RHINOCEROS AND DINOCERAS Nat
It foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon be telling
The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy brutes like nothing living, disappeared
The evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the geological record
We have a fairly complete series of forms from a small tapirlike ancestor in the early Cainozoic
IX MONKEYS, APES AND SUBMEN Naturalists divide the class Mammalia into a number of orders
At the head of these is the order Primates, which includes the lemurs, the monkeys, apes and man
Their classification was based originally upon anatomical resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities
Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher in the geological record
The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to an end
Once more the earth spun towards an ice age
The world chilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again
Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages
A great weeding and extinction of species occurred
Then century by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept southward
In England it came almost down to the Thames, in America it reached Ohio
There would be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold
We live today in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter
These traces are not bones but implements
These things have been called Eoliths dawn stones
For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely unhuman but intelligent monkey

The archologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers, borers, knives, darts, throwing stones and hand axes
We are drawing very near to man
These are, at the closest, related forms
It sheltered in caves from the cold
It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them
It was righthanded as men are
Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men
They were of a different species of the same genus
They had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads
They probably slouched along, head down and forward
Their chinless jawbones resemble the Heidelberg jawbone and are markedly unlike human jawbones
And there were great differences from the human pattern in their teeth
Their intellectual faculties were differently arranged
They were not ancestral to the human line
Mentally and physically they were upon a different line from the human line
They must have endured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of years
THE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF
RUTOT THE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF
Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots
His level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary
We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like
He may have been very hairy and very unhumanlooking indeed
It is even doubtful if he went erect
He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold himself up
Probably he went about alone or in small family groups
Their braincases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as our own
So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of mankind begins
COMPARISON OF MODERN SKULL AND RHODESIAN SKULL COMPARISON OF MODERN SKULL AND RHODESIAN SKULL Nat
The world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate was still austere
We do not know where the True Men first originated
The teeth also and the bones are quite human
The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape like, Neanderthaler face
This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer to real men than the Neanderthal Man
The Rhodesian skull itself may not be very ancient
Up to the time of publishing this book there has been no exact determination of its probable age
It may be that this subhuman creature survived in South Africa until quite recent times
from , years ago or more, have been discovered in both these countries
, painted in the soft tones of red shaded to black
One of these races was of a very high type indeed it was tall and big brained
One of the womens skulls found exceeds in capacity that of the average man of today
One of the mens skeletons is over six feet in height
The physical type resembled that of the North American Indian
From the CroMagnon cave in which the first skeletons were found these people have been called CroMagnards
They were savages, but savages of a high order
The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters
Its nearest living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa
The earliest of them were hunters
Their chief pursuit was the wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time
They followed it as it moved after pasture
And also they followed the bison
They knew the mammoth, because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of that creature
To judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it
They hunted with spears and throwing stones
They had no dogs
Since they had no cooking implements their cookery must have been rudimentary or nonexistent
They knew nothing of cultivation and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth
Except for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted savages
Europe, century by century, was growing milder and damper
Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed
The steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place of horse and bison
There is a change in the character of the implements with this change in their application
River and lake fishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine implements of bone increased
The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of this epoch
These were the Azilians named from the Mas dAzil cave
Against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies
One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees nest
FIGHT OF BOWMEN Among the most recent discoveries of Palolithic Art are these specimens found in in Spain
The Neolithic Age New Stone Age was beginning
They seem to have degenerated rather than developed
They lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game
They had no habitations but only squatting places
So a child or an uneducated person does today
And even today those who really control and order their thoughts are but a small minority of mankind
Most of the world still lives by imagination and passion
Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the true human story, were small family groups
The mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young
An anthropological writer of great genius, J
He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods
Some of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again
The women would tell them to the children and so establish a tradition
RELICS OF THE STONE AGE RELICS OF THE STONE AGE Chert implements from Somaliland
In general form they are similar to those found in Western and Northern Europe Brit
For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quite talkative beings
In that way they have differed from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them
The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal
You do so and so, he said, and so and so happens
You give a child a poisonous berry and it dies
You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong
There we have two bits of cause and effect association, one true one false
It differs from modern science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more frequently wrong
Another great concern of his was illness and death
Occasionally infections crept through the land and men died of them
Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any manifest cause
This too must have given the hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise
He had the childs aptitude for fear and panic
This they declared unpropitious and that imperative, this an omen of good and that an omen of evil
The expert in Fetish, the Medicine Man, was the first priest

This lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days
It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of the stars
But once their use in determining seasons was realized, their importance to agriculture became very great
The seedtime sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent star
A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almost inevitable consequence
For there have always been witches as well as wizards, and priestesses as well as priests
The early priest was really not so much a religious man as a man of applied science
SPECIMEN OF NEOLITHIC POTTERY SPECIMEN OF NEOLITHIC POTTERY Dug up at Mortlake from the Thames Bed Brit
Age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went on between these communities
Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the term Heliolithic culture for the culture of these first agricultural peoples
Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental expert
The term Palolithic we may note is also used to cover the Neanderthaler and even the Eolithic implements
XIV PRIMITIVE NEOLITHIC CIVILIZATIONS About , B
the geography of the world was very similar in its general outline to that of the world today
About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were fertile and habitable
Generally it was a moister and more fertile world
This great race had of course a number of varieties
Its western varieties are whiter than its eastern
The central parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture
Human races do not branch out like trees with branches that never come together again
It is a thing we need to bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any opportunity
It will save us from many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so
They will speak of a British race or of a European race
But nearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, darkwhite, white and Mongolian elements
A MAYA STELE A MAYA STELE Showing a worshipper and a Serpent God
Note the grotesque faces in the writing Brit
Apparently they came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward
They found caribou, the American reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison in the south
They probably exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big
The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting nomadic Neolithic life
They never discovered the use of iron, and their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper
But in Mexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about B
or so arose very interesting civilizations of a parallel but different type from the oldworld civilization
These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy
They knew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall presently tell
In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious and elaborate character
The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about or A
There is nothing quite like it in the old world
The nearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings
Everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out
The Mexican civilization in particular ran blood it offered thousands of human victims yearly
The public life, the national festivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act
NEOLITHIC WARRIOR NEOLITHIC WARRIOR Modelled from drawing by Prof
Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good
The Maya writing was not only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the like
A similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago
In the old world before or B
In America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this primitive stage
Each of them was in a little world of its own
Mexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeans came to America
The potato, which was the principal food stuff in Peru, was unknown in Mexico
Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made their sacrifices and died
Maya art rose to high levels of decorative beauty
Men made love and tribes made war
Drought and plenty, pestilence and health, followed one another
XV SUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITING The old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new
About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the great history of Egypt was beginning
These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent noses
They employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and their language is now known
They had discovered the use of bronze and they built great towerlike temples of sundried brick
They had cattle, sheep, goats and asses, but no horses
They fought on foot, in close formation, carrying spears and shields of skin
Their clothing was of wool and they shaved their heads
But sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from their population
Its god and its priestking claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea
BRICK OF HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLON ABOUT B
BRICK OF HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLON ABOUT B
Even before Neolithic times men were beginning to write
The Azilian rock pictures to which we have already referred show the beginning of the process
Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of these the human figures are plainly drawn
From this to a conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition
In the rebus dear to children of a suitable age, this is still done today
Egyptian writing underwent parallel developments
The invention of writing was of very great importance in the development of human societies
It put agreements, laws, commandments on record
It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible
It made a continuous historical consciousness possible
It is interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used
So close had civilization got to printing six thousand years ago
Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent
To that fact we owe a great wealth of recovered knowledge
McLeish THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDEREH THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDEREH Photo D
Most of the people in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivationexcept on days of religious festivity
They had no money and no need for it
They managed their small occasional trades by barter
In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest, most splendid of beings
There were few changes in the world in those days mens days were sunny, toilsome and conventional
Few strangers came into the land and such as did fared uncomfortably
Sometimes the ruler was benign
Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years
Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus, who built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh
The largest of these is feet high and the weight of stone in it is ,, tons
All this was brought down the Nile in boats and lugged into place chiefly by human muscle
Its erection must have exhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done
Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of India, and China
But over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible
The transition from the hunting to the herding life may have been very gradual
POTTERY AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE LAKE DWELLERS POTTERY AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE LAKE DWELLERS Brit
In many ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil
The individual was more selfreliant less of a unit in a crowd
The leader was more important the medicine man perhaps less so
It depicts the arrival of a tribe of Semitic Nomads in Egypt about the year of B
Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of life
He touched on the confines of this settled land and that
He was used to the sight of strange faces
He had to scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes
He may have been a better metallurgist
Possibly bronze and much more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries
FLINT KNIVES OF B

They would bring precious stones and things of metal and leather
If they were hunters they would bring skins
They would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments and suchlike manufactured things
Away in the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly race
The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before B
For very much of Russia there was swamp and lake
They came as traders and as raiders
Finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors
Discovered in among the ruins of Susa, Persia About B
It was consolidated by a great king called Hammurabi circa B
who made the earliest code of laws yet known to history
Such boats are still used there
The hollow log followed as tools improved
The building of boats and then ships came in a natural succession
It is only in the last four hundred years that the wellrigged, oceangoing, sailing ship has developed
As ships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves
In the west these same Semitic peoples were taking to the sea
Of Carthage, one of these Phnician cities, we shall have much more to tell later
But the Phnicians were not the first people to have galleys in the Mediterranean waters
, that is between the time of Sargon I and Hammurabi, Cretan civilization was at its zenith
Cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the Cretan monarch and his people
It was not even fortified
There he held great festivals and shows
The womens clothes were remarkably modern in spirit they wore corsets and flounced dresses
And they had a system of writing, but that still remains to be deciphered
This happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of centuries
Cnossos and Babylon abounded in comfortable and cultivated people who probably led very pleasant lives
Life must have seemed very secure in Cnossos for such people, sunlit and girdled by the blue sea
To a Cretan gentleman of B
Compare that with our modern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere
Perhaps our Cretan tried to talk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish
This creature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an altogether benighted savage
disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon its prosperity
We do not know how this disaster occurred
The excavators note what appears to be scattered plunder and the marks of the fire
But the traces of a very destructive earthquake have also been found
Nature alone may have destroyed Cnossos, or the Greeks may have finished what the earthquake began
a vigorous patriotic movement expelled these foreigners
Followed a new phase or revival for Egypt, a period known to Egyptologists as the New Empire
The Pharaohs became aggressive conquerors
They had now acquired the war horse and the war chariot, which the Hyksos had brought to them
Under Thothmes III and Amenophis III Egypt had extended her rule into Asia as far as the Euphrates
At first Egypt was ascendant
At last the Assyrians became the greatest military power of the time
Tiglath Pileser III conquered Babylon in B
and founded what historians call the New Assyrian Empire
Assyria became the first power to expound the doctrine of blood and iron
But Egypt was already a conquered country then under an Ethiopian dynasty
Sardanapalus simply replaced one conqueror by another

THE GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL AT KARNAK THE GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL AT KARNAK Photo D
McLeish Round the northeast of the Black and Caspian Seas were coming the Medes and Persians
Confused with these in the records of the time were Scythians and Samatians
They were raiders and robbers and plunderers of cities, these Ayrans, east and west alike
They were all kindred and similar peoples, hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder
The gean peoples were so pressed that they were seeking new homes in lands beyond the Aryan range
In Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not cause fundamental changes until after B
The great temples at Karnak and Luxor date from this time
, and this period also covers most of the splendours of Babylon
And there were few utensils of iron copper and bronze remained the prevailing metals
Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool
But there was no silk yet
Glass was known and beautifully coloured, but glass things were usually small
There was no clear glass and no optical use of glass
People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no spectacles on their noses
Most trade was still done by barter
Babylon was financially far ahead of Egypt
A merchant or traveller would carry precious stones to sell to pay for his necessities
Most servants and workers were slaves who were paid not money but in kind
As money came in slavery declined
A French cook would have found small joy in Babylon
These things came from the East somewhere about the time of the last Assyrian empire
Religion like everything else had undergone great refinement
Human sacrifice for instance had long since disappeared animals or bread dummies had been substituted for the victim
In India and China there were parallel developments
They were nearer the level of the ancient Sumerians or of the Maya civilization of America
Chinese history has still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much legendary matter
Probably China at this time was in advance of India
The chief duty of these early emperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices
XIX THE PRIMITIVE ARYANS Four thousand years ago, that is to say about B
These Nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed in the worlds history
They burnt their important dead they did not bury them ceremoniously as the brunette peoples did
These mounds are the round barrows that occur all over north Europe
They had bronze, and somewhen about B
They may have been the discoverers of iron smelting
, and also with the Greek frieze, p
They were a very vocal people
The social life of these people centred about the households of their leading men
The hall of the chief where they settled for a time was often a very capacious timber building
Cowsheds and stabling surrounded it
The chief owned the cattle and grazing lands in the common interest forest and rivers were the wild
They were coming into France and Britain and into Spain
They pushed westward in two waves
The first of these people who reached Britain and Ireland were armed with bronze weapons
They are called the Goidelic Celts
From them the Welsh derive their language
They did not always conquer
In the eighth century B
At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar progress southward of similar tribes
Aryan peoples, speaking Sanskrit, had come down through the western passes into North India long before B
There they came into contact with a primordial brunette civilization, the Dravidian civilization, and learnt much from it
In Eastern Turkestan there are still fair, blueeyed Nordic tribes, but now they speak Mongolian tongues
They were already coming southward and crossing into Asia Minor many centuries before B
The Greeks had taken to the sea before A
The theme of history from the ninth century B
In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B
we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a town meant loot and massacre
Conquerors sought to propitiate and win the conquered
But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly
By that time Assyria was grappling with foes nearer at hand, and could make but a poor resistance
for now we are coming down to exact chronologytook that city
There was a division of the spoils of Assyria
A Median Empire was set up in the north under Cyaxares
It included Nineveh, and its capital was Ecbatana
Eastward it reached to the borders of India
The last great days, the greatest days of all, for Babylon began
For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares
Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria
, and he pushed on to the Euphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a renascent Babylonia
The Chaldeans dealt very vigorously with the Egyptians
the Second Babylonian Empire flourished insecurely
It flourished so long as it kept the peace with the stronger, hardier Median Empire to the north
And during these sixtyseven years not only life but learning flourished in the ancient city
Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian, had been quite Babylonized
His collection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material in the world
The last of the Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs, Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes
Cyrus had already distinguished himself by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor
His soldiers entered the city without fighting
Possibly the priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the wall
Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible

Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the swiftest method of transport
Moreover the world was now beginning to use coined money, which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse
But the capital of this vast empire was no longer Babylon
In the long run the priesthood of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason
The capital was Susa
Nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins
They were settled in Judea long before B
, and their capital city after that time was Jerusalem
Their country was an inevitable high road between these latter powers and Egypt
This literature appears in history in the fourth or fifth century B
Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon
Josiah King of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and slain at Megiddo B
Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant of the people was carried off captive to Babylon
There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon B
Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or united people
Probably only a very few of them could read or write
The Babylonian captivity civilized them and consolidated them
They returned aware of their own literature, an acutely selfconscious and political people
So too the stories of Moses and of Samson have Sumerian and Babylonian parallels
But with the story of Abraham and onward begins something more special to the Jewish race
Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon
He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad
They may have done this somewhen between B
there are no Egyptian records of Moses nor of Canaan at this time to help out the story
For very largely it is a record of disasters and failures frankly told
they chose themselves a king, Saul, to lead them in battle
With David dawned the only period of prosperity the Hebrew peoples were ever to know
He wished to secure a trade route to the Red Sea through the Hebrew hill country
A very considerable trade passed northward and southward through Jerusalem
And Solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence unprecedented in the experience of his people
He was even given a daughter of Pharaoh in marriage
But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind
At the climax of his glories Solomon was only a little subordinate king in a little city
The account of Solomons magnificence given in the books of Kings and Chronicles is questioned by many critics
They say that it was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers
But the Bible account read carefully is not so overwhelming as it appears at the first reading
Jerusalem remained the capital city of Judah
Hiram died, and the help of Tyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem
Egypt grew strong again
It is a tale of disasters and of deliverances that only delayed disaster
It is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people
Judah struggled on until in B
, as we have told, it shared the fate of Israel
It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history together and evolved their tradition
They had learnt civilization
These Prophets mark the appearance of new and remarkable forces in the steady development of human society
In the seventh century B
it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world was to be dominated by Semitic rulers
The trade of the world was in Semitic hands
Carthage, founded before B
, had risen to a population of more than a million
It was for a time the greatest city on earth
Its ships went to Britain and out into the Atlantic
They may have reached Madeira
In the time of the Pharaoh Necho, a Phnician expedition sailed completely round Africa
At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians
no one could have prophesied that before the third century B
But the Arab Bedouin were never conquered by Aryan masters
It is not so much the Jews who made the Bible as the Bible which made the Jews
All other peoples had national gods embodied in images that lived in temples
If the image was smashed and the temple razed, presently that god died out
They were a people exalted by their sense of a common destiny
This belief saturated them all when they returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon
And they were all held together by the Bible and by the reading of the Bible
Jerusalem was from the first only their nominal capital their real city was this book of books
This is a new sort of thing in history
, held together and consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of the written word
As troubles thicken round the divided Hebrews the importance of these Prophets increases
Panel showing Jewish captives bringing tribute What were these Prophets They were men of the most diverse origins
They came without licence or consecration
Now the word of the Lord came unto me that was the formula
They were intensely political
Some of them turned their attention to what we should now call social reform
They went wherever the Jews went, and wherever they went they spread a new religious spirit
That is their supreme importance in the history of mankind
Therein the Jewish prophecies culminate
XXIII THE GREEKS Now while after Solomon whose reign was probably about B
The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan speaking stem
They had come down among the gean cities and islands some centuries before B
For in those days there were elephants in Mesopotamia and lions in Greece
These epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or seventh century B
We need not concern ourselves with such bickerings here
The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without writing, and still not living in cities
They began to trade and send out colonies
By the seventh century B
There were already Greek settlements along the coast of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily
The heel and toe of Italy was called Magna Grcia
Marseilles was a Greek town established on the site of an earlier Phnician colony
The cities of Egypt and the cities of Sumeria, for example, ran together under one system of government
They are different even in race
Few came up even to ,
There were unions of interest and sympathy but no coalescences
They had leaders and noble families, but no quasi divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court
Rather their organization was aristocratic, with leading families which kept each other in order
The Greek democracies were not like our modern democracies in which everyone has a vote
Generally in Greece affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men
They were the first republicans of importance in history
We find already in the sixth century B
These Greek enquirers who begin to be remarkable in the sixth century B
are the first philosophers, the first wisdomlovers, in the world
And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century B
was in the history of humanity
From Athens to the Pacific the human mind was astir
, found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world
A new element which was increasing rapidly in this empire was the Greek element
It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe
He wanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian horsemen
His army suffered terribly
Darius was forced into an inglorious retreat
Darius resolved upon the subjugation of the Greeks in Europe
he made his main attack upon Athens
There they were met and signally defeated by the Athenians
An extraordinary thing happened at this time
The Persian fleet had returned to Asia
So ended the first Persian attack on Greece
The next was much more impressive
For a time terror united all the Greeks
The army of Xerxes was certainly the greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world
It was a huge assembly of discordant elements
It crossed the Dardanelles, B
Every man was killed
Thebes surrendered and made terms
The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt
Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came victory against the odds and all expectations
Xerxes found himself and his immense army cut off from supplies and his heart failed him
Most of the Greek cities in Asia became free
This Herodotus was born about B
From Mycal onward Persia sank into a confusion of dynastic troubles
Xerxes was murdered in B
and rebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media broke up the brief order of that mighty realm
The history of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of Persia
This history is indeed what we should now call propagandapropaganda for Greece to unite and conquer Persia
You on the other hand have now attained the utmost skill in war
No other nations in the world have what they possess gold, silver, bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves
All this you might have for yourselves, if you so desired
and that in B
The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens
For over thirty years to B
The beautiful ruins that still glorify Athens today are chiefly the remains of this great effort
And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens
He rebuilt Athens intellectually
He gathered about him not only architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and teachers
Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history B
Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the sun and stars
But one cannot reason without matter, and knowledge followed in the wake of speech
A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates
In the end Socrates was executed for disturbing peoples minds B
His young men carried on his teaching
Compare the advance of art with that seen in the animals shown on p
who presently began to teach philosophy in the grove of the Academy
You are not awake to your own power
He made no Utopias
And so Aristotle began that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science
He sent out explorers to collect facts
He was the father of natural history
He was the founder of political science
His students at the Lyceum examined and compared the constitutions of different states
Here in the fourth century B
we find men who are practically modern thinkers
Free, exact and systematic thinking has begun
XXVI THE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT From to B
the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece
Meanwhile to the north of Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly to power and civilization
a man of very great abilities and ambition became king of this little countryPhilip
He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to remodel his army
Mounted horsemen had also fought, but as a cloud of skirmishers, individually and without discipline
Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot the horses
With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly to Greece and the battle of Chronia B
, fought against Athens and her allies, put all Greece at his feet
At last the dream of Herodotus was bearing fruit
his advanced guard crossed into Asia upon this long premeditated adventure
But he never followed it
He was assassinated it is believed at the instigation of his queen Olympias, Alexanders mother
She was jealous because Philip had married a second wife
At Chronia Alexander, who was then only eighteen years old, had been in command of the cavalry
He kept along the seacoast
he met and smashed a vast conglomerate host under Darius III
Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted obstinately
Finally that great city was stormed and plundered and destroyed
Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of B
the conqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the Persians
To these the trade of the Phnician cities was diverted
Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Rameses and Necho had done before him
But he marched by way of Tyre
Darius led the retreat
He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled northward into the country of the Medes
Alexander marched on to Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and Persepolis
There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of Darius, the king of kings
At first he turned northward
He was still living when the foremost Greeks reached him
Alexander came up to find him dead
after an absence of six years
He then prepared to consolidate and organize this vast empire he had won
He sought to win over his new subjects
He had much trouble with them
He never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned
A fever seized him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in B
Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces
The rest of the empire remained unstable, passing under the control of a succession of local adventurers
Barbarian raids began from the north and grew in scope and intensity
Traces of this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia and in northwest India
Their influence upon the development of Indian art was profound
Here the Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke Greek
He set himself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and investigation
He also wrote a history of Alexanders campaigns which, unhappily, is lost to the world
He set up a foundation in Alexandria which was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria
For two or three generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was extraordinarily good
Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a frequent correspondent of the Museum
Herophilus was one of the greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised vivisection
But it did not continue
There may have been several causes of this decline
This was all very well when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle
The Museum produced little good work after its first century of activity
Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the finding of fresh knowledge
He tried also to set up an encyclopdic storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria
It was not simply a storehouse, it was also a bookcopying and bookselling organization
A great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies of books
The foundation of this Museum and Library marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind
It is the true beginning of Modern History
ARISTOTLE ARISTOTLE From Herculaneum, probably Fourth Century B
Singer Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under serious handicaps
Clear glass does not seem to have interested him
The metal worker made weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance
He was not interested in substances
So Alexandria in its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry
Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making
That ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp
Paper was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until the ninth century A
The only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge
It was these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books
It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off from the world at large
Within the blaze may be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen
Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria
Thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown lay hidden
Then it stirred and began to germinate
THE DEATH OF BUDDHA THE DEATH OF BUDDHA GrcoBuddhist carving from Sivat Valley, N
Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in the third century B
But this brilliant Hellenic world was now stricken by invasion from the north
They raided, shattered and destroyed
They were an able but unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to either science or art
in much the same fashion that the Medes and Persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth
But of these latter people we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter
All these men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century B
unaware of one another
This sixth century B
was indeed one of the most remarkable in all history
Everywherefor as we shall tell it was also the case in Chinamens minds were displaying a new boldness
It is as if the race had reached a stage of adolescenceafter a childhood of twenty thousand years
The early history of India is still very obscure
Somewhen perhaps about B
Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit
And throughout history this stratification into castes continues
This makes the Indian population something different from the simple, freely interbreeding European or Mongolian communities
It is really a community of communities
Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a small district on the Himalayan slopes
He was married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin
He hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens and groves and irrigated ricefields
And it was amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him
It was the unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment
These men lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in religious discussion
This is another tie to break, said Gautama
He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen
He resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith
Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of his age
But his acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him
His fame spread, like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies
But it brought him no sense of truth achieved
One day he was walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state
Suddenly he fell unconscious
When he recovered, the preposterousness of these semimagical ways to wisdom was plain to him
THE DHAMKH TOWER THE DHAMKH TOWER In the Deer Park at Sarnath
Such a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age
His disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to Benares
So it happened to Gautama
It seemed to him that he saw life plain
The Indian teacher did not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it
All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the individual
Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is trouble and his end sorrow
There were three principal forms that the craving for life took and they were all evil
All these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses and chagrins of life
Before he was well dead, a cycle of fantastic legends began to be woven about him
Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world
There was a quickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and selfforgetful ends
Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever seen
Chandragupta was able to secure the help or various hill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help
He built up an empire in North India and was presently B
His son extended this new empire
His grandson, Asoka, the monarch of whom we now have to tell, found himself in B
ruling from Afghanistan to Madras
He invaded Kalinga B
He would have no more of it
He organized a great digging of wells in India and the planting of trees for shade
He founded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for the growing of medicinal herbs
He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines and subject races of India
He made provision for the education of women
Missionaries went from Asoka to Kashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon and Alexandria
TRANSOME SHOWING THE COURT OF ASOKA TRANSOME SHOWING THE COURT OF ASOKA India Mus
ASOKA PANEL FROM BHARHUT ASOKA PANEL FROM BHARHUT India Mus
Such was Asoka, greatest of kings
He was far in advance of his age
Gradually they undermined the Buddhist influence in the land
The old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed their sway
Caste became more rigorous and complicated
In this history thus far we have told very little of the early story of China
If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal sacrifices before the dawn of history
And a form of picture writing was growing up long before a thousand years B
At any rate we find that by B
The Shang dynasty came to an end in B
Gradually China went to pieces during that long Chow period
Hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities local rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent
There was in the sixth century B
, says one Chinese authority, five or six thousand practically independent states in China
It was what the Chinese call in their records an Age of Confusion
In all these cases insecurity and uncertainty seemed to have quickened the better sort of mind
Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official importance in a small state called Lu
The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him profoundly
Confucius died a disappointed man
The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or aristocratic man
He was the most publicminded of all great teachers
He sought to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent to provide sound rules for every occasion in life
He left writings very contracted in style and very obscure
He wrote in riddles
The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst stage in the sixth century B
The power of Tsin became predominant
His son, ShiHwangti king in B
, emperor in B
, is called in the Chinese Chronicles the First Universal Emperor
More fortunate than Alexander, ShiHwangti reigned for thirtysix years as king and emperor
His energetic reign marks the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people
China was Mongolized just as Greece and North India were Aryanized and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized
They questioned the beliefs of immemorial ages
They let daylight into the temples
They set up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among their captains and companions
Travel is increasing and transport growing easier by reason of horses and roads
A new and easy device to facilitate trade has been found in coined money
Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story
It was before B
a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated
They had reversed the usual process by subjugating various Aryan tribes
The old chronologies gave B
Etruscan tombs of a much earlier date than B
have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum
In that redletter century, the sixth century B
, the Etruscan kings were expelled B
and Rome became an aristocratic republic with a lordly class of patrician families dominating a commonalty of plebeians
Except that it spoke Latin it was not unlike many aristocratic Greek republics
For while she still struggled at home, she was extending her power abroad
Until that time they had waged war, and generally unsuccessful war, with the Etruscans
, however, a great misfortune came to the Etruscans
Their fleet was destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily
At the same time a wave of Nordic invaders came down upon them from the north, the Gauls
Caught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans felland disappear from history
Veii was captured by the Romans, The Gauls came through to Rome and sacked the city B
but could not capture the Capitol
The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened Rome
To this they had reached within a few years of B
They looked about for some help against these new conquerors
, and having driven them north, he turned his attention to the subjugation of Sicily
And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus
The Gauls were raiding south
They were raiding down through Illyria which is now Serbia and Albania to Macedonia and Epirus
, and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina
The Carthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily and allies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates B
and put in a Carthaginian garrison there
The pirates appealed to Rome and Rome listened to their complaint
XXXII ROME AND CARTHAGE It was in B
that the great struggle between Rome and Carthage, the Punic Wars, began
That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world
The First Punic War began in B
about the pirates of Messina
The advantage of the sea was at first with the Carthaginians
At the battle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading battleships had only been triremes with three banks
and at Ecnomus B
the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten
But after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery
and Carthage sued for peace
All Sicily except the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded to the Romans
Both had trouble enough at home
Rome pushed forward to the Alps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to Illyria
Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts in Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power
Finally, an act of intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the two revolting islands
Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro
To that boundary the Romans restricted them
At last in B
at the hands of Scipio Africanus the Elder
The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War
For fiftysix years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace
Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regaining something of her former prosperity
Her recovery revived the hate and suspicion of the Romans
She was attacked upon the most shallow and artificial of quarrels B
, she made an obstinate and bitter resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed B
They were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately destroyed
The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of ceremonial effacement
Map The Extent of the Roman Power its Alliances about B
So ended the Third Punic War
To a large extent they were still the traders and bankers of the world
The Semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced
and after various vicissitudes of quasi independence and revolt was besieged by them in A
and captured after a stubborn struggle
The Temple was destroyed
A later rebellion in A
completed its destruction, and the Jerusalem we know today was rebuilt later under Roman auspices
It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror
But it was the first republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh developments
This westward position enabled Rome to bring in to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples
They were assimilated just as before them the Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated
The only people who exercised any great mental influence upon them before the second or third century A
were the kindred and similar Greeks
It was so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic
It cannot be called a successful experiment
In the end their empire collapsed altogether
And it changed enormously in form and method from century to century
It changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt changed in a thousand
It was always changing
It never attained to any fixity
In a sense the experiment failed
Macaulays Lays of Ancient Rome, S
The items of that picture have to be disentangled
We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages
The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in B
and went on until the end of the First Punic War B
We may call this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic
It was perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history
At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely twenty miles square
She fought the sturdy but kindred states about her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence
Her centuries of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and concessions
Great roads were made
The rapid Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a policy
all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of Rome
Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an extended city
This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole countries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion
It reversed the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether
By the Roman method the conquerors assimilated the conquered
Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey
It was declared an estate of the Roman people
Its rich soil and industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich
The patricians and the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of that wealth
And the war also brought in a large supply of slaves
Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been largely a population of citizen farmers
Military service was their privilege and liability
The republic had altered its character
Rome had entered upon its second stage, the Republic of Adventurous Rich Men
The First Punic War wasted them and robbed them of all they had won
The governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in number
The first and more important was the Senate
It was much more like the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate
For three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of Roman political thought and purpose
The second body was the Popular Assembly
This was supposed to be an assembly of all the citizens of Rome
When Rome was a little state twenty miles square this was a possible gathering
When the citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one
In the fourth century B
By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic of a vanquished popular control
No effectual legal check remained upon the big men
No one thought of electing delegates to represent the will of the citizens
This is a very important point for the student to grasp
In theory it was all the citizens in practice it ceased to be anything at all worth consideration
The story of the second and first centuries B
, so far as internal politics go, is a story of futile revolutionary upheaval
There was revolt and civil war
, the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a great insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus
This insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty
The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating and degrading him
And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply of free spirited fighting farmers declined
It was a popular leader named Marius who introduced a new factor
North Africa after the overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semibarbaric kingdom, the kingdom of Numidia
Marius was made consul, in a phase of public indignation, to end this discreditable war
This he did by raising paid troops and drilling them hard
Jugurtha was brought in chains to Rome B
There was no power in Rome to restrain him
Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had served under him in Africa
Each in turn made a great massacre of his political opponents
Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand, and their estates were sold
It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus
Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired with great wealth into private life
Crassus thrusting further invaded Persia and was defeated and slain by the Parthians
After a long rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Csar B
and murdered in Egypt, leaving Julius Csar sole master of the Roman world
He has become a legend and a symbol
The revolt of Spartacus marked a third phase
Julius Csar made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France and Belgium
, where however he made no permanent conquest
Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea
When presently Crassus was killed at distant Carrh by the Parthians, Pompey and Csar fell out
he crossed the Rubicon, saying The die is cast and marched upon Pompey and Rome
After his overthrow of Pompey, Csar was made dictator first for ten years and then in B
In effect he was made monarch of the empire for life
Csar refused to be king, but adopted throne and sceptre
She seems to have turned his head very completely
He had brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a godking
His statue was set up in a temple with an inscription To the Unconquerable God
Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities followed
Octavian like his uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces where the best legions were recruited
But Octavian was a man of different quality altogether from Julius Csar
He had no foolish craving to be God or King
He had no queenlover that he wished to dazzle
He restored freedom to the Senate and people of Rome
He declined to be dictator
The grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms of power
He was to be called not King indeed, but Princeps and Augustus
He became Augustus Csar, the first of the Roman emperors B
He was followed by Tiberius Csar to A
and he by others, Caligula, Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan A
, Antonius Pius A
and Marcus Aurelius A
All these emperors were emperors of the legions
The soldiers made them, and some the soldiers destroyed
Gradually the Senate fades out of Romanhistory, and the emperor and his administrative officials replace it
The boundaries of the empire crept forward now to their utmost limits
He abandoned some of the acquisitions of Trajan
The expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end
XXXIV BETWEEN ROME AND CHINA The second and first centuries B
mark a new phase in the history of mankind
Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the centre of interest
Power had drifted to the west and to the east
Two great empires now dominated the world, this new Roman Empire and the renascent Empire of China
Rome extended its power to the Euphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary
It was too remote
But there, too, it reached its extremes
Beyond was too far
China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most civilized political system in the world
It was superior in area and population to the Roman Empire at its zenith
To the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses
In the eastward lap of the elevated part of Asia was the great triangle of Manchuria
Their rainfall has varied greatly in the course of a few centuries They are lands treacherous to man
The thrust of the Han empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous
The Chinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall
The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the Chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them
Some took the former course and were absorbed
Some drifted northeastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western Turkestan
VASE OF BRONZE FORM, UNGLAZED STONEWARE VASE OF BRONZE FORM, UNGLAZED STONEWARE Han Dynasty B
In the Victoria and Albert Museum This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from B
They fought against Pompey the Great in his eastern raid
They defeated and killed Crassus
They replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty of Parthian kings, the Arsacid dynasty
It was India which received the Mongolian drive in these centuries of Roman and Chinese strength
A series of raiding conquerors poured down through the Punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy
The empire of Asoka was broken up, and for a time the history of India passes into darkness
These invasions went on for several centuries
For a large part of the fifth century A
In the second century A
This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence
It raged for eleven years in China and disorganized the social framework profoundly
with the coming of the great Tang dynasty
The infection spread through Asia to Europe
It raged throughout the Roman Empire from to A
It evidently weakened the Roman imperial fabric very seriously
The province of Dacia vanished from Roman history
A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome
Compared with the past, with the time before B
, life had become much more loose
Over Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and the Hellenized East generally, the Latin language never prevailed
Greek ruled there invincibly
Septimius Severus, who was emperor from to A
, spoke Carthaginian as his mother speech
It civilized these countries for the first time
Northwest Africa also became at last largely Latinspeaking
Egypt, Greece and the rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized
They remained Egyptian and Greek in culture and spirit
In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were naturally also very miscellaneous
The chief industry of the settled world was still largely agriculture
Although they came to form a majority of the country population they never made a successful insurrection
The insurrection of Spartacus in the first century B
was an insurrection of the special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats
They had no wives of their own they could be outraged, mutilated and killed by their masters
A master could sell his slave to fight beasts in the arena
POMPEII POMPEII Note the ruts in roadway worn by chariot wheels
Mines and metallurgical operations, the rowing of galleys, roadmaking and big building operations were all largely slave occupations
And almost all domestic service was performed by slaves
It probably varied widely in different places and at different periods
There were armed slaves
At the opening of the period of the Punic wars, in B
, the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revived in Rome
And also there were learned slaves
The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a slave
A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and slave secretaries and learned men
He would keep his poet as he would keep a performing dog
In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved
The slaves still boast and quarrel in our reviews
There were enterprising people who bought intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale
Slaves were trained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled callings
In the second century B
But already in the first century A
there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman civilization towards slavery
Captives were not so abundant for one thing, and slaves were dearer
But also the moral tone of the community was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective
The higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness
The free will and the free mind were nowhere to be found
Athens decayed under the Roman sceptre
The science of Alexandria decayed
The spirit of man, it seemed, was decaying in those days
Compulsion and cruelty reigned there were pride and display but little honour little serenity or steadfast happiness
The unfortunate were despised and wretched the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager for gratifications
Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins
Life went on in that key
The uneasiness of mens hearts manifested itself in profound religious unrest
Observances and the fear of disturbed routines, sacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds
There was no change in its general character
Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a religious revolution
Under the Ptolemies and under the Csars, her temples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian
If the two gods were alike in character they were identified
It was really the same god under another name, said the priests and the people
was an age of theocrasia
Or the god of a defeated people would become a malignant antagonist to the brighter gods
The history of theology is full of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once local gods
As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was much of this theocrasia
Later on he was to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull
Associated with him was the goddess Isis
Isis was also Hathor, a cowgoddess, and the crescent moon and the Star of the sea
The Egyptian religion was an immortality religion as no other religion had ever been
These were Serapis who was OsirisApis rechristened, Isis and Horus
This worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence extended, even into North India and Western China
Serapis was called the saviour of souls
After death, said the hymns of that time, we are still in the care of his providence
Isis attracted many devotees
Her images stood in her temples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant Horus in her arms
The rise of the Roman empire opened the western European world to this growing cult
But there were many rivals to the SerapisIsis religion
Prominent among these was Mithraism
Here we seem to have something more primordial than the complicated and sophisticated SerapisIsis beliefs
We are carried back directly to the blood sacrifices of the heliolithic stage in human culture
The votary to Mithraism actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull
They aim at personal salvation and personal immortality
The older religions were not personal like that they were social
The sacrifices were a public and not a private function
They concerned collective practical needs in this world in which we live
But the Greeks first and now the Romans had pushed religion out of politics
Guided by the Egyptian tradition religion had retreated to the other world
BUST OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS, A
BUST OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS, A
Represented as the God Mithras, Roman, Circa A
For the Csars had learnt from the Pharaohs the possibility of being gods
There might be local and eccentric gods
Seville, for example, long affected the worship of the old Carthaginian Venus
Sometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the political side of the state religion
They would not even salute the Roman standards for fear of idolatry
Obscure Greek cults practised similar disciplines even to the extent of selfmutilation
Asceticism appeared in the Jewish communities of Judea and Alexandria also in the first century B
Communities of men abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities and mystical contemplation
Such was the sect of the Essenes
Throughout the first and second centuries A
Now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and theology apart
The historian, if he is to remain historian, can neither accept nor deny that interpretation
He appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius Csar
He was a prophet
He preached after the fashion of the preceding Jewish prophets
Our only direct sources of information about the life and teaching of Jesus are the four Gospels
All four agree in giving us a picture of a very definite personality
One is obliged to say, Here was a man
This could not have been invented
He was clearly a personto use a common phraseof intense personal magnetism
He attracted followers and filled them with love and courage
Weak and ailing people were heartened and healed by his presence
Long before these two were dead his sufferings were over
With dismay and anger they heard Jesus sweeping away their dear securities
God was the loving father of all life, as incapable of showing favour as the universal sun
And all men were brotherssinners alike and beloved sons alikeof this divine father
There are no privileges, no rebates and no excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven
The whole kingdom of Heaven was to be the family of his followers
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee
Again and again he denounced private riches and the reservation of any private life
And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these things have I observed from my youth
And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved for he had great possessions
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St
He had never seen Jesus nor heard him preach
Then he was suddenly converted to Christianity, and he changed his name to Paul
He was well versed in Judaism and in the Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day
He carried over many of their ideas and terms of expression into Christianity
When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each others ceremonial and other outward peculiarities
Yet the original teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly opposed
All these religions were flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults
Each was seeking adherents, and there must have been a constant going and coming of converts between them
Sometimes one or other would be in favour with the government
This made it a seditious religion, quite apart from the revolutionary spirit of the teachings of Jesus himself
PETER AND PAUL POINTING TO A THRONE, ON GOLD BACKGROUND MOSAIC OF SS
Prassede, Rome In the Victoria and Albert Museum St
The Arians taught that Jesus was divine, but distant from and inferior to the Father
It may be found in its completest expression in the Athanasian Creed
We offer no comment on these controversies here
They do not sway history as the personal teaching of Jesus sways history
It may be true, as hostile critics of Christianity have urged, that St
The attitude of the emperors varied between hostility and toleration
The destruction of the books is particularly notable
These book religions, Christianity and Judaism, were religions that educated
Their continued existence depended very largely on people being able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas
The older religions had made no such appeal to the personal intelligence
The persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress the growing Christian community
He abandoned all divine pretensions and put Christian symbols on the shields and banners of his troops
In a few years Christianity was securely established as the official religion of the empire
Rome halfway down Italy was too far from the centre of interest to be a convenient imperial seat
It was a declining city
Over most of the empire peace still prevailed and men went about without arms
Diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental robes
All along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the Rhine and Danube, enemies were now pressing
The Franks and other German tribes had come up to the Rhine
But now Mongolian peoples were forcing their way towards Europe
The Huns were already exacting tribute from the Alans and Ostrogoths and pushing them to the west
In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a renascent Persia
A glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the peculiar weakness of the empire
It makes a square reentrant angle there
Against this square angle of the Danube the barbarian pressure was greatest
When they broke through there it was inevitable that the empire should fall into two parts
Constantine the Great was certainly a monarch of great devotion and intelligence
He was too preoccupied with the internal weaknesses of the empire
This newmade Byzantium, which was rechristened Constantinople in his honour, was still building when he died
Towards the end of his reign occurred a remarkable transaction
The Vandals, being pressed by the Goths, asked to be received into the Roman Empire
But these new legionaries remained under their own chiefs
Rome failed to digest them
Nominally they were subjects of the emperor, practically they were conquerors
CONSTANTINES PILLAR, CONSTANTINOPLE CONSTANTINES PILLAR, CONSTANTINOPLE Photo Sebah Foaillier From to A
reigned the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and while he reigned the empire was still formally intact
When Theodosius died at the close of the fourth century he left two sons
Alaric supported one of these, Arcadius, in Constantinople, and Stilicho the other, Honorius, in Italy
In other words Alaric and Stilicho fought for the empire with the princes as puppets
In the course of their struggle Alaric marched into Italy and after a short siege took Rome A
It is difficult to visualize the state of affairs in the world at that time
Life in them must have been shallow, mean and full of uncertainty
The churches went on, but usually with illiterate priests
There was little reading and much superstition and fear
The life of the countryside had also degenerated
Everywhere this Roman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had been
In some regions war and pestilence had brought the land down to the level of a waste
Roads and forests were infested with robbers
The complete obelisk is seen on page
But let the Vandals serve as an example
They came into history in east Germany
They settled as we have told in Pannonia
Thence they moved somewhen about A
through the intervening provinces to Spain
There they found Visigoths from South Russia and other German tribes setting up dukes and kings
From Spain the Vandals under Genseric sailed for North Africa , captured Carthage , and built a fleet
They were at the climax of their power about
They were a mere handful of conquerors holding all this country
The story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of similar adventures
It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward drift of the nomadic Mongolians
A third contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal decay and falling population of the Roman Empire
So we have the factors of thrust, means and opportunity
There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and an open road
The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the first century A
, but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries A
that these horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes
The fifth century was the Huns century
Presently they were in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest of the Vandals
By the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had arisen among the Huns, Attila
We have only vague and tantalizing glimpses of his power
He exchanged ambassadors with China
His head camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube
The common folk were in huts and tents the chiefs lived in great stockaded timber halls
There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards
It looked like history repeating itself upon a larger stage
The Huns raided and plundered but did not settle
For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose
Nearly every town in northern Gaul was sacked
This checked him in Gaul, but it did not exhaust his enormous military resources
Next year he came into Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua and looted Milan
The actual Huns disappear from history, mixed into the surrounding more numerous Aryanspeaking populations
But these great Hun raids practically consummated the end of the Latin Roman Empire
The Vandals from Carthage took and sacked Rome in
So ingloriously the Latin Roman Empire came to an end
In Theodoric the Goth became King of Rome
There were hundreds and perhaps thousands of such practically independent brigand rulers
The superior clergy and a small remnant of other educated men read and wrote Latin
Everywhere life was insecure and property was held by the strong arm
Castles multiplied and roads fell into decay
Had it not been for the monks and Christian missionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether
Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship
The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no one observed it die
All empires, all states, all organizations of human society are, in the ultimate, things of understanding and will
There remained no will for the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an end
Throughout the fourth and fifth centuries A
while the empire was decaying, Christianity was spreading to a universal dominion in Europe
It conquered its conquerors, the barbarians
The Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the entire Christian church
Now that there were no more emperors, he began to annex imperial titles and claims
It weathered the disasters of the fifth century A
, which saw a complete and final breaking up of the original Latin Roman power
Most of Asia Minor was held against the Sassanid Persians
Justinian reconquered North Africa from the Vandals and most of Italy from the Goths
He even regained the south of Spain
He did not limit his energies to naval and military enterprises
He founded a university, built the great church of Sta
Sophia in Constantinople and codified the Roman law
From the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been the steadfast rival of the Byzantine
The two empires kept Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt in a state of perpetual unrest and waste
In the first century A
Alexandria, like Constantinople, continued a dwindling trade between the east and the west
THE CHURCH NOW A MOSQUE OF S
SOPHIA, CONSTANTINOPLE THE CHURCH NOW A MOSQUE OF S
In both Persia and Byzantium it was all age of intolerance
THE MAGNIFICENT ROOFWORK IN S
SOPHIA THE MAGNIFICENT ROOFWORK IN S
But these older religions were essentially religions of act and fact
They did not invade the mind
But the new sort of religions that had come into the world, and particularly Christianity, turned inward
These new faiths demanded not simply conformity but understanding belief
Naturally fierce controversy ensued upon the exact meaning of the things believed
These new religions were creed religions
And already before the end of the fourth century both empires were persecuting free talk and religious innovation
Before the end of the third century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity, and in A
Mani, the founder of a new faith, the Manichans, was crucified and his body flayed
Constantinople, on its side, was busy hunting out Christian heresies
All ideas became suspect
War, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind constituted Byzantine life of those days
It was picturesque, it was romantic it had little sweetness or light
At first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor Chosroes II carried all before him
In he conquered Egypt
Byzantium and Persia had fought their last war
While Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message reached him
It was from someone who called himself Muhammad the Prophet of God
It called upon the Emperor to acknowledge the One True God and to serve him
What the Emperor said is not recorded
A similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon
He was annoyed, tore up the letter, and bade the messenger begone
He was preaching a new religion of faith in the One True God
Even so, O Lord he said rend thou his Kingdom from Kavadh
The Parthians had gone out of history, absorbed into the general population of Persia
There were no more Aryan nomads in the history of Central Asia Mongolian people had replaced them
The Turks became masters of Asia from China to the Caspian
The same great pestilence at the end of the second century A
that had shattered the Roman Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty in China
The new China that had arisen was a very different land from the old China of the Hans
There were great advances in artistic work, in technical skill and in all the amenities of life
Tea was first used, paper manufactured and woodblock printing began
He received an embassy from Heraclius, who was probably seeking an ally in the rear of Persia
From Persia itself came a party of Christian missionaries
They were allowed to explain their creed to Taitsung and he examined a Chinese translation of their Scriptures
He pronounced this strange religion acceptable, and gave permission for the foundation of a church and monastery
To this monarch also in came messengers from Muhammad
They came to Canton on a trading ship
They had sailed the whole way from Arabia along the Indian coasts
Unlike Heraclius and Kavadh, TaiTsung gave these envoys a courteous hearing
India also was divided and wasted
And such a prophecy would not have been an altogether vain one
No Semitic people had founded an empire now for more than a thousand years
Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour
They spread their rule and language from Spain to the boundaries of China
They gave the world a new culture
Until he was forty he did very little to distinguish himself in the world
He seems to have taken considerable interest in religious discussion
There can be no doubt that his thoughts were very strongly influenced by Jewish and Christian ideas
Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his forerunners
He had been chosen to complete and perfect the revelation of Gods will
Hostilities followed between Mecca and Medina which ended at last in a treaty
So Muhammad established the One True God in Mecca without injuring its pilgrim traffic
Regarded as literature or philosophy the Koran is certainly unworthy of its alleged Divine authorship
Another is its complete detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple
It is an entirely prophetic religion, proof against any possibility of relapse towards blood sacrifices
These are the things that made Islam a power in human affairs
Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu Bekr sustained him
Large elements in the population went over to Islam
Then the Moslim turned east
The tide of conquest poured along the north coast of Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar and Spain
Spain was invaded in and the Pyrenees Mountains were reached in
They made repeated sea attacks between and but the great city held out against them
Map The Growth of the Moslem Power in Years Map The Moslem Empire, A
From the very beginning doctrinal differences undermined its unity
It found Greek learning in Egypt also
Everywhere, and particularly in Spain, it discovered an active Jewish tradition of speculation and discussion
In Central Asia it met Buddhism and the material achievements of Chinese civilization
It learnt the manufacture of paperwhich made printed books possiblefrom the Chinese
And finally it came into touch with Indian mathematics and philosophy
Learning sprang up everywhere in the footsteps of the Arab conquerors
By the eighth century there was an educational organization throughout the whole Arabized world
Long after the political breakup and enfeeblement of the Arabs, this intellectual community of the Arabspeaking world endured
It was still producing very considerable results in the thirteenth century
Very great advances were made in mathematical, medical and physical science
The very name algebra is Arabic
So is the word chemistry
Their philosophy was destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of France and Italy and the whole Christian world
The crabbed patient experimenting of these Arab alchemists spread into the Christian world
The fascination of their enquiries spread
Very gradually the activities of these alchemists became more social and cooperative
They found it profitable to exchange and compare ideas
By insensible gradations the last of the alchemists became the first of the experimental philosophers
A thousand years before, the Aryanspeaking races were triumphant over all the civilized world west of China
Yet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted
That world was divided up among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could
This feudal system was a sort of crystallization of society about power
His lord again found safety in vassalage to a still greater lord
The pyramids grew up until some became recognizable as kingdoms
This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary
He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking French Latin, and High and Low German languages
His son Pepin extinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the kingly state and title
He conquered North Italy and made himself master of Rome
One driving force was this ambition of successful rulers, which Charlemagne Charles the Great embodied, to become Csar
The realm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal German states at various stages of barbarism
East of the Rhine, the racially similar German peoples did not lose their German speech
There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and claiming the allegiance of all Europe
When Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the empire he revived
It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire and Greek Empire should develop very readily
And still more readily did the rivalry of Greekspeaking Christianity and the newer Latinspeaking version develop
The Pope of Rome claimed to be the successor of St
Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the head of the Christian community everywhere
Neither the emperor nor the patriarch in Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this claim
The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and remained thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic
They had taken to the sea and piracy, and were raiding all the Christian coasts down to Spain
They had come out upon the Caspian and Black Seas as pirates also
They set up principalities in Russia they were the first people to be called Russians
These Northmen Russians came near to taking Constantinople
Under Rolph the Ganger another band of Northmen conquered the north of France, which became Normandy
It is interesting to speculate what might have happened if this temporary union of the Northmen had endured
They were a race of astonishing boldness and energy
They sailed in their galleys even to Iceland and Greenland
They were the first Europeans to land on American soil
Later on Norman adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens and sack Rome
To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of Slav tribes and Turkish peoples
Prominent among these were the Magyars or Hungarians who were coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth centuries
Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the Roman Empire were the Saracens
The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his personality is but indistinctly seen
The Pope succeeded in crowning his visitor and conqueror by surprise in St
Peters on Christmas Day A
He produced a crown, put it on the head of Charlemagne and hailed him Csar and Augustus
There was great applause among the people
Otto descended upon Rome and was crowned emperor there in
The Duke of Normandy, the King of France and a number of lesser feudal rulers remained outside
At the time of Hugh Capet the King of France ruled only a comparatively small territory round Paris
Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews and Arabs during these centuries of European darkness
They guarded the neglected seeds of science and philosophy
Northeast of the Caliphs dominions was a number of Turkish tribes
Then they struck at the remnants of the Byzantine power in Asia Minor
They took the fortress of Nica over against Constantinople, and prepared to attempt that city
The Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror
He wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and his successor Alexius Comnenus wrote still more urgently to Urban II
The declared object of this war was the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the unbelievers
The fruits of centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in the response
A great wave of enthusiasm swept the western world, and popular Christendom discovered itself
The Hebrew prophets, Jesus and his disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters of mens individual souls
They brought the personal conscience face to face with God
Before that time religion had been much more a business of fetish, of pseudoscience, than of conscience
The new kind of religion made a man of him
The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common people in European history
Before very long we shall find it stirring again, and raising the most disturbing social and religious questions
Certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully and lamentably
This was the peoples crusade
Two great mobs blundered into Hungary, mistook the recently converted Magyars for pagans, committed atrocities and were massacred
So began and ended this first movement of the European people, as people
Next year the real fighting forces crossed the Bosphorus
Essentially they were Norman in leadership and spirit
They stormed Nica, marched by much the same route as Alexander had followed fourteen centuries before, to Antioch
The siege of Antioch kept them a year, and in June they invested Jerusalem
It was stormed after a months siege
The slaughter was terrible
Men riding on horseback were splashed by the blood in the streets
THE HORSES OF S
MARK, VENICE THE HORSES OF S
During the Great War of they were hidden away for fear of air raids
McLeish Immediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again
The Crusaders discovered themselves between Byzantine and Turk and fighting both
He preached a Holy War against the Christians, recaptured Jerusalem in , and so provoked the Third Crusade
This failed to recover Jerusalem
It started from Venice and in it stormed Constantinople
Upon the wealth of confidence such lives created rested the power of the church
Next but one after him came Urban II , the Pope of the First Crusade
From Bulgaria to Ireland and from Norway to Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme
In at Venice the Emperor Frederick Frederick Barbarossa, knelt to Pope Alexander III and swore fealty to him
It failed to retain the moral prestige on which its power was based
Penitent sinners were exhorted to do so
Accordingly in many European countries as much as a fourth of the land became church property
The appetite for property grows with what it feeds upon
The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very greatly
And these lands were really under foreign dominion
For also the clergy claimed exemption from taxation
They paid their taxes to Rome
These were enormous powers, and enormous powers are only to be used on extraordinary occasions
The Popes used them at last with a frequency that staled their effect
But the high claims of the Pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct of the clergy
The church had its own law courts
Whenever the layman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go to a clerical court
The obligations of peace and war fell upon his shoulders alone and left the priest free
It is no great wonder that jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian world
Never did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of common men
In four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles
On the other hand the fiercely orthodox order of the Dominicans, founded by St
The story of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from without but continually of decay from within
Unhappily none of these things obtained
That very great papal statesman Hildebrand Pope Gregory VII, did much to regularize the election
And the career of everyone of the great Popes ended in a note of interrogation
At his death the church might be left headless and as ineffective as a decapitated body
Or he might be replaced by some old rival eager only to discredit and undo his work
Or some enfeebled old man tottering on the brink of the grave might succeed him
Under the circumstances it is no great wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile
The astonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous men
The struggle of this monarch against Rome is a turning place in history
He inherited this kingdom in when he was a child of four years
Innocent III had been made his guardian
No doubt they were at some pains to make their point of view clear to him
He talked freely on the subject his heresies and blasphemies are on record
As the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his guardian
Innocent III wanted altogether too much from his ward
When the opportunity came for Frederick to succeed as Emperor, the Pope intervened with conditions
Frederick must promise to put down heresy in Germany with a strong hand
And the German clergy were to be freed from all taxation
Frederick agreed but with no intention of keeping his word
Frederick II was denied all the comforts of religion
In the halfArab Court of Sicily this produced singularly little discomfort
To this Frederick replied in a document of diabolical ability
He suggested a union of princes against this usurpation
He directed the attention of the princes specifically to the wealth of the church
Having fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to perform his twelveyearold promise and go upon a crusade
This was the Sixth Crusade
It was as a crusade, farcical
Frederick II went to Egypt and met and discussed affairs with the Sultan
This indeed was a new sort of crusade, a crusade by private treaty
Here was no blood splashing the conqueror, no weeping with excess of joy
Those days were past
He proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscation of church propertyfor the good of the church
It was a suggestion that never afterwards left the imagination of the European princes
We will not go on to tell of his last years
The particular events of his life are far less significant than its general atmosphere
It is possible to piece together something of his court life in Sicily
He was luxurious in his way of living, and fond of beautiful things
He is described as licentious
But it is clear that he was a man of very effectual curiosity and inquiry
He also founded a zoological garden
Italian poetry was indeed born at his court
A series of Popes pursued the policy of supporting the French monarchs
For a time he carried things with a high hand
In he held a jubilee, and a vast multitude of pilgrims assembled in Rome
But this festival was a delusive triumph
The idea of Christendom had decayed until its power over the minds of men had gone
Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its moral sway
The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a Frenchman, the choice of King Philip of France
He never came to Rome
But Gregory XI did not take the sympathies of the whole church with him
Many of the cardinals were of French origin and their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon
This split is called the Great Schism
Each Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival
But other forces were more frankly disobedient and critical
A century and a half later came Wycliffe
He was a learned Doctor at Oxford
He was a more learned and far abler man than either St
This desecration was not the act of some isolated fanatic it was the official act of the church
These were the Mongols
Their central camp was at Karakorum in Mongolia
At this time China was in a state of division
In Jengis Khan, the leader of the Mongol confederates, made war on the Kin Empire and captured Pekin
He died master of a vast empire that reached from the Pacific to the Dnieper
His successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career of conquest
Kieff was destroyed in , and nearly all Russia became tributary to the Mongols
The Emperor Frederick II does not seem to have made any great efforts to stay the advancing tide
were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of numbers
Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their Asiatic conquests
By the middle of the thirteenth century they had conquered the Sung Empire
From that time until our own Mesopotamia has been a desert of ruins, sustaining only a scanty population
After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed
The dominions of the Great Khan fell into a number of separate states
The eastern Mongols became Buddhists, like the Chinese the western became Moslim
He was the most savage and destructive of all the Mongol conquerors
He established an empire of desolation that did not survive his death
Map The Ottoman Empire at the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, A
They very nearly took Vienna, and they exacted it tribute from the Emperor
There were but two items to offset the general ebb of Christian dominion in the fifteenth century
The causes of this revival were many and complex
They were all trading cities with many travellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think
Still more influential in the stirring up of mens ideas were the Jews
Their very existence was a note of interrogation to the claims of the church
And the stir in mens minds was by no means confined now to the independent and well educated
His name deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of Aristotle
His writings are one long tirade against ignorance
He told his age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do
Roger Bacons writings were like a flash of light in a profound darkness
Experiment, experiment, that is the burthen of Roger Bacon
Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul
It is scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe possible
Paper originated in China, where its use probably goes back to the second century B
Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist
But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly
Another was a cheapening of schoolbooks
The knowledge of reading spread swiftly
With this increase in the facility of reading, the reading public grew
The book ceased to be a highly decorated toy or a scholars mystery
People began to write books to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people
They wrote in the ordinary language and not in Latin
With the fourteenth century the real history of the European literature begins
So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the European revival
Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol conquests
They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe enormously
The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered
Great hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity
Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a primitive paganism
He went to China about with his father and uncle, who had already once made the journey
Their visit with Marco was their second visit
ANCIENT BRONZE FIGURE FROM BENIN, W

They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding the Mongol domains at this time
At Ormuz they met merchants from India
At Pekin was the Great Khan, and they were hospitably entertained
He was given an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly in southwest China
He told of Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country
He may also have been sent on a mission to India
The publication of Marco Polos travels produced a profound effect upon the European imagination
In Seville there is a copy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus
There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese should be turned in this direction
The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over mens minds
The idea of going westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one
It was encouraged by two things
Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put his idea to the test
He went from one European Court to another
The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously
In the Portuguese sailed round Africa to India, and in there were Portuguese ships in Java
Thirtyone men were aboard her, survivors of twohundredand eighty who had started
Magellan himself had been killed in the Philippine Isles
The reign of the Latin mind was now drawing to an end
L THE REFORMATION OF THE LATIN CHURCH The Latin Church itself was enormously affected by this mental rebirth
It was dismembered and even the portion that survived was extensively renewed
The Great Schism had reduced its religious and political prestige to negligible proportions
The forces of insurrection struck it now from both sides
The teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely throughout Europe
This teaching spread rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused great popular enthusiasm
In a Council of the whole church was held at Constance to settle the Great Schism
Five Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people and all of them failed
But the Bohemian Czechs, unlike the Waldenses, believed in armed resistance
After the Hussite Wars these peasant insurrections increased in gravity in Germany and took on a religious character
Printing came in as an influence upon this development
The art spread to Italy and England, where Caxton was printing in Westminster in
At first he disputed in Latin in the fashion of the Schoolmen
They sought to make themselves in person the heads of a more nationalized religion
England, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, North Germany and Bohemia, one after another, separated themselves from the Roman Communion
They have remained separated ever since
They refused the disciplines of a state church
But the shock and stress of these losses produced changes perhaps as profound in the Roman Church itself
The church was reorganized and a new spirit came into its life
It carried Christianity to India, China and America
It arrested the rapid disintegration of the Roman Church
The vigorous and aggressive Roman Catholic Church we know today is largely the product of this Jesuit revival
He was one of the most extraordinary monarchs that Europe has ever seen
For a time he had the air of being the greatest monarch since Charlemagne
His greatness was not of his own making
It was largely the creation of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I
Some families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power the Habsburgs married their way
Most of Burgundy slipped from him after his first wifes death, but the Netherlands he held
Then he tried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany
He became Emperor in succession to his father, Frederick III, in , and married the duchy of Milan
He succeeded to the Netherlands in
He found himself in a world of young and vigorous personalities
It was an age of brilliant young monarchs
Both Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to the imperial electors
At first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the hands of his ministers
Then slowly he began to assert himself and take control
He began to realize something of the threatening complexities of his exalted position
It was a position as unsound as it was splendid
But he had been brought up in Spain, that most Catholic of countries, and he decided against Luther
So he came into conflict with the Protestant princes and particularly the Elector of Saxony
His attempts to close that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective
There was an extensive peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the general political and religious disturbance
And these internal troubles were complicated by attacks upon the Empire from east and west alike
His social and political troubles were complicated by financial distresses
He was forced to ruinous borrowing
They stormed the city and pillaged it
The Pope took refuge in the Castle of St
Angelo while the looting and slaughter went on
He bought off the German troops at last by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats
Ten years of such confused fighting impoverished all Europe
At last the Emperor found himself triumphant in Italy
In , he was crowned by the Popehe was the last German Emperor to be so crownedat Bologna
Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary
Francis and Charles then formed an alliance against the Turk
Of that struggle he saw only the opening war
The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in these gathering troubles
He gathered diets and councils in futile attempts at reconciliation
Formul and confessions were tried over
Here we do but mention them as details in the worried life of this culminating Emperor
Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to the Protestant side
The German religious war began in , a few months after the death of Martin Luther
We need not trouble about the incidents of the campaign
The Protestant Saxon army was badly beaten at Lochau
In , to the great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died
Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for thirtytwo years
It is interesting to note how entirely the European mind was concentrated upon the struggle for European ascendancy
It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display his distinctive originality of mind
He was now entirely bored and disillusioned by his imperial greatness
A sense of the intolerable futility of these European rivalries came upon him
There he died in

The one seems naturally to follow, like a running commentary, on the other
It is rare that such topics have formed the burden of communications with the department of state
On Thursdays he was to bring fish to serve for the jour maigre that was to follow
Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an important place in the royal bill of fare
On an eelpasty he particularly doted
Eating and doctoring it was a return to elemental things
The appearance of Protestant teaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury
And almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his preoccupation with funerals
Within two months of this masquerade he was dead
And the brief greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him
His realm was already divided between his brother and his son
To this day its unburied tradition still poisons the political air
Prescotts Appendix to Robertsons History of Charles V
The empires grew in size and range, and mens ideas grew likewise to correspond with these things
Came the disappearance of local gods, the age of theocrasia, and the teaching of the great world religions
For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in Greece and Alexandria was interrupted
Gradually at this point and that, the search for knowledge, the systematic scientific process, was resumed
The former cheapened, spread, and revolutionized teaching, public information and discussion, and the fundamental operations of political activity
The latter made the round world one
This destroyed the practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities
Guns swept away feudalism
Constantinople fell to guns
Mexico and Peru fell before the terror of the Spanish guns
He was the pupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of another Englishman Dr
Gilbert, the experimental philosopher of Colchester
The exploration and mapping of the world went on
Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand appeared on the map
With the onset of the nineteenth century the real fruition of sciencewhich indeed henceforth may never ceasebegan
Here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these various national dramas in detail
Louis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe
He made bribery a state method almost more important than warfare
His money, or rather the money of the tax paying classes in France, went everywhere
But his prevailing occupation was splendour
Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateaux to the new pattern
A great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings developed
But now there was also an Emperor of the East again
His grandson, Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible , assumed the imperial title of Csar Tsar
The Tsar Peter the Great brought Russia into the arena of Western affairs
In Russia as in Prussia French became the language of the court
All these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of aggrandizement against each other
Each one of them pursued a foreign policy of aggression against its neighbours and of aggressive alliances
A tittletattle of bribes and rivalries disgusts the intelligent student
Very soon however the Portuguese asked for a share
The Portuguese at this time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward and eastward
The wars of Europe extended themselves to these claims and possessions
The tradition of the Latin Empire entangled them least
They struck root and increased and multiplied, giving the British a great advantage in the American struggle
Step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm their ships
It had come to buy and sell, and it found itself achieving a tremendous piracy
There was no one to challenge its proceedings
Upon Clive Parliament passed a vote of censure
He committed suicide in
In Warren Hastings, a second great Indian administrator, was impeached and acquitted
It was a strange and unprecedented situation in the worlds history
Their imaginations declined the task
India remained romantically unreal
It was impossible for the English, therefore, to exert any effective supervision and control over the companys proceedings
Then the Manchus, another Mongol people, reconquered China and remained masters of China until
Meanwhile Russia was pushing East and growing to greatness in the worlds affairs
Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also contributed to the Cossack mixture
New lands were offered them in Asia
The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is very difficult to explain
Some authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching from China also had a pacifying influence upon them
Particularly did the mines of Spanish America yield silver
In the north they sought furs
Mines and plantations necessitated settlements
They obliged people to set up permanent overseas homes
France had abandoned America
These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and character
There was no natural common unity in such states
The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British the first fighting occurred at Concord
In the same year the French and Spanish declared war upon Great Britain, greatly hampering her sea communications
So the United States of America came into existence
Canada remained loyal to the British flag
Forces were at work in the world however that were to arrest the process of differentiation altogether
They became a constellation of republican states, very prone at first to wars among themselves and to revolutions
Brazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable separation
From that time on until they separated, Portugal was rather a dependency of Brazil than Brazil of Portugal
In Brazil declared itself a separate Empire under Pedro I, a son of the Portuguese King
But the new world has never been very favourable to monarchy
We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of the personal monarchies in Europe
It was the envy and model of a multitude of competing and minor courts
But it flourished on a basis of injustice that led to its dramatic collapse
It was brilliant and aggressive, but it was wasteful of the life and substance of its common people
The peasants were ground down by taxation the middle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility
It had not assembled since
For all that time France had been an absolute monarchy
Now the people found a means of expressing their long fermenting discontent
The king Louis XVI prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from the provinces
Whereupon Paris and France revolted
The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift
In a month the ancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had collapsed
Many of the leading princes and courtiers of the queens party fled abroad
It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost
For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle through to an effective modernized government
Much of its work was sound and still endures, if much was experimental and had to be undone
There was a clearing up of the penal code torture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were abolished
The ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundy and the like gave place to eighty departments
Promotion to the highest ranks in the army was laid open to men of every class
And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people
There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic
All Europe, all the world, was to become Republican
Then the French Government did an unwise thing
She drove the Austrians for ever out of Belgium, and made Holland a republic
The Dutch fleet, frozen in the Texel, surrendered to a handful of cavalry without firing its guns
Atkinson, What astonished the Allies most of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans
These improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them
The first represented the decisioncompelling spirit, the second the spirit of risking little to gain a little
The revolution was now under the sway of a fanatical leader, Robespierre
This man is difficult to judge he was a man of poor physique, naturally timid, and a prig
But he had that most necessary gift for power, faith
So that to keep in power was to save the Republic
To which there seemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing royalists
The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering began
The invention of the guillotine was opportune to this mood
Their reign formed a curious interlude in this history of violent changes
They took things as they found them
Everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up
The last feature of Grand Monarchy that France was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign policy
One discovers it still as vigorous under the Directorate as if there had been no revolution
He gave that country ten years of glory and the humiliation of a final defeat
This was that same Napoleon Bonaparte who had led the armies of the Directory to victory in Italy
Throughout the five years of the Directorate he had been scheming and working for selfadvancement
Gradually he clambered to supreme power
He was a man of severely limited understanding but of ruthless directness and great energy
His utmost political imagination carried him to a belated and tawdry attempt to restore the Western Empire
The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman Emperor and became simply Emperor of Austria
Napoleon divorced his French wife in order to marry an Austrian princess
His son was crowned King of Rome
For some years Napoleons reign was a career of victory
He conquered most of Italy and Spain, defeated Prussia and Austria, and dominated all Europe west of Russia
Germany rose against him, Sweden turned against him
The French armies were beaten back and at Fontainebleau Napoleon abdicated
He died a British prisoner at St
The forces released by the French revolution were wasted and finished
For nearly forty years a sort of peace, a peace of exhausted effort, was maintained in Europe
In his article, French Revolutionary Wars, in the Encyclopdia Britannica
The second was the impossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of Vienna
Here even the Inquisition was restored
The George Washington of South America was General Bolivar
In Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X
After all, France was still a monarchy
This man Louis Philippe remained the constitutional King of France for eighteen years
Frenchspeaking Savoy it combined with pieces of Italy to restore the kingdom of Sardinia
The Tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alien Finns
The very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples were bound together under one king
Germany, the reader will see, was left in a particularly dangerous state of muddle
The King of Denmark came into the German confederation by virtue of certain Germanspeaking possessions in Holstein
Map Europe after the Congress of Vienna In there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the Turks
For six years they fought a desperate war, while the governments of Europe looked on
Much blood had still to run however before the Turk was altogether expelled from these lands
Nor was it affecting popular thought very profoundly during this period
It was a process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous and independentspirited people
Machinery on a new scale and in a new abundance appeared to revolutionize industry
In Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and made the first locomotive
From onward railways multiplied
By the middle of the century a network of railways had spread all over Europe
After the Russian disaster, Napoleon travelled from near Vilna to Paris in hours
This was a journey of about , miles
He was travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averaged under miles an hour
An ordinary traveller could not have done this distance in twice the time
Then suddenly came this tremendous change
The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to less than fortyeight hours
The full significance of that possibility in Europe still remains to be realized
Europe is still netted in boundaries drawn in the horse and road era
In America the effects were immediate
It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible
THE STEAMBOAT CLERMONT, , U
THE STEAMBOAT CLERMONT, , U
The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine in its earlier phases
So, too, was the first ship using steam she also had sails to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah
All these were paddlewheel boats and paddlewheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas
The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled
The screw steamship followed rather slowly
Many difficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a practicable thing
After that the evolution in sea transport was rapid
The electric telegraph came into existence in
The first underseas cable was laid in between France and England
It was material for a craftsman
Quality and treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual ironworker
There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of cannon
The blastfurnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with the use of coke
Not before the eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron and rolled rods and bars
Nasmyths steam hammer came as late as
The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not use steam
The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available
The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods
Yet we are still in the stage of the first fruits in the matter
We have the power, but we have still to learn how to use our power
Many of the first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid or horrible
Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science of electricity grew up
British science was largely the creation of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the ordinary centres of erudition
Inventors and discoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people to profit by
In this matter the Germans were a little wiser
The German learned did not display the same vehement hatred of the new learning
They permitted its development
Knowledge, these Germans believed, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers
By the aeroplane was available for human locomotion
AN EARLY WEAVING MACHINE AN EARLY WEAVING MACHINE From an engraving by W
They are merely one aspect of a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility
The science of agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made quite parallel advances during the nineteenth century
In a little more than a century this mechanical revolution has been brought about
A new gigantic material framework for human affairs has come into existence
Clearly it demands great readjustments of our social, economical and political methods
Even the factory method came before power and machinery
Factories were the product not of machinery, but of the division of labour
There were factories in Rome in the days of Augustus
New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the booksellers
There are intimations of it even as early as Mores Utopia
It was a social and not a mechanical development
A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction and the like, contributed
A vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery
At its onset, powerdriven machinery did not seem to promise any release from such unintelligent toil
Great gangs of men were employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the like
The number of miners increased enormously
But the extension of facilities and the output of commodities increased much more
And as the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly
Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power
What could be done mechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine
The human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised
Human beings were wanted only as human beings
For ploughing, sowing and harvesting, swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men
For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer
He had to be educatedif only to secure industrial efficiency
He had to understand what he was about
Christian controversies, with their competition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of popular education
The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly apprehended by the common people of Rome
It was only in that great century of human adolescence, the sixth century B
And at first it was chiefly material knowledge that increased
The first fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material achievements and material power
The advances made in them have been slower and made against greater opposition
The Neapolitan Campanellas City of the Sun was more fantastic and less fruitful
His treatises on government, toleration and education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social reconstruction
He stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France
What is Socialism There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a thousand sects of Socialists
We may review the history of that idea through the ages very briefly
CARL MARX CARL MARX Photo Linde Co
The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species
Long before men were men, the ancestral ape was a proprietor
Primitive property is what a beast will fight for
No more nonsensical expression is conceivable in sociology than the term primitive communism
Human society grew by a compromise between this ones property and that
Each of us would have preferred to have it my land, but that would not work
In that case the other fellows would have destroyed us
Society, therefore, is from its beginning a mitigation of ownership
It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in our reason
Men could own what they were the first to make or capture or claim
It seemed natural that a debtor who could not pay should become the property of his creditor
We find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves
But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the interrogative stage in this matter
It had got nothing clear enough, much less settled enough, to act upon
It was largely to protect private property from taxation that the French Revolution began
To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set about dividing up
They wanted to intensify and universalize property
The state a democratic state was of course understood was to own all property
But so it was
They open up issues in social psychology, and interact with the enquiries of educational science
The criticism of property is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science
In some way the classconscious workers would seize power, he prophesied, and inaugurate a new social state
Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shall note later, has proved singularly uncreative
But from the starting point of modern individualistic thought it is also possible to reach international ideas
The logic of reality triumphs over the logic of theory
Mens acts waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole they rather gravitate towards the traditional
Financial and monetary expedients also become worldwide interests to be dealt with successfully only on worldwide lines
Infectious diseases and the increase and migrations of population are also now plainly seen to be worldwide concerns
Along that line to world unity the resistances are too great
Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with international ones
They are products of the same instinctive tendencies, and the same ignorances and traditions
Internationalism is the socialism of nations
Our proposed solutions are still vague and crude
Passion and suspicion surround them
But as they grow clearer they will gather power over the minds and imaginations of men
Their present lack of grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact rightness
They are misunderstood because they are variously and confusingly presented
But with precision and certainty the new vision of the world will gain compelling power
It may presently gain power very rapidly
And a great work of educational reconstruction will follow logically and necessarily upon that clearer understanding
Politically the United States embodied, and its constitution crystallized, the liberal ideas of the middle eighteenth century
Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already called attention
These things happened to come along just in time to save American unity
The United States of today were made first by the river steamboat, and then by the railway
Without these things, the present United States, this vast continental nation, would have been altogether impossible
The westward flow of population would have been far more sluggish
It might never have crossed the great central plains
The first state established beyond the river was the steamboat state of Missouri in
But the rest of the distance to the Pacific was done in a few decades
Then somewhere about would come a change
Things would get more lively along the river courses
The dots would be multiplying and spreading
That would be the steamboat
Without railways or telegraph it would be far easier to administer California from Pekin than from Washington
Nay, it has become more uniform
And the process of assimilation goes on unimpeded
Soon aviation will be helping in the work
This great community of the United States is an altogether new thing in history
We want a new term for this new thing
We call the United States a country just as we call France or Holland a country
But the two things are as different as an automobile and a onehorse shay
The former were slaveholding states the latter, states in which all men were free
There was little possibility of compromise
The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas to the Union
The return of Abraham Lincoln as an antiextension President in decided the South to split the Union
South Carolina passed an ordinance of secession and prepared for war
His early years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward flow of the population
He was born in Kentucky , was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois
But his mother taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader
At seventeen he was a big athletic youth, a great wrestler and runner
There was a terrible waste and killing of men
Thrust was followed by counter thrust hope gave way to despondency, and returned and was again disappointed
Sometimes Washington seemed within the Confederate grasp again the Federal armies were driving towards Richmond
The Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources, fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee
The generalship of the Union was far inferior
Meanwhile Grant held Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him
But for Lincoln there was no doubt
He was a clearminded man in the midst of much confusion
He stood for union he stood for the wide peace of America
He was for emancipation by stages and with compensation
The French army in Mexico was trampling the Monroe Doctrine in the dirt
But Lincoln would not listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of the Union was maintained
The Americans might do such things as one people but not as two
He saw the Union triumphant
He entered Richmond the day after its surrender, and heard of Lees capitulation
He returned to Washington, and on April th made his last public address
His theme was reconciliation and the reconstruction of loyal government in the defeated states
But Lincolns work was done the Union was saved
But the social tension due to the development of urban industrialism grew
France remained a conspicuously uneasy country
The revolution of was followed by another in
Then Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, became first President, and then in Emperor
He set about rebuilding France, and made it into a brilliantlooking modernized imperialism
After the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh cycle of wars
They were chiefly balanceof power and ascendancy wars
Map of Europe, In came a longpending struggle for predominance in Europe between France and Prussia
Prussia had long foreseen and prepared for this struggle, and France was rotten with financial corruption
Her defeat was swift and dramatic
Peace was signed at Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to the Germans
For the next fortythree years Germany was the leading power upon the European continent
Only the Russian sprawled as large as ever across Asia
Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements in the Philippine Islands
Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of her ancient claims
France had one or two West Indian islands and French Guiana
Only the East India Company showed any spirit of expansion
Its power spread to Assam, Sind, Oudh
In , Lord Beaconsfield, to complete the work, caused Queen Victoria to be proclaimed Empress of India
Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the present time
India is an autocracy without an autocrat
Its rule combines the disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the impersonality and irresponsibility of democratic officialdom
Improvements in transport were also making Australian wool an increasingly marketable commodity in Europe
It was the railway that altered the Canadian outlook
The railway, the steamship and the telegraph cable were indeed changing all the conditions of colonial development
In New Zealand also was added to the colonial possessions of the British Crown
Close to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely known possibilities
In it was a continent of black mystery only Egypt and the coast were known
Little heed was given to the welfare of the natives in this scramble
No European power has perfectly clean hands in this matter
Majuba Hill was made to rankle in the memory of the English people by a persistent press campaign
Their period of subjugation was a brief one
In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed
They had no sense of the transferability of science and its fruits
In Germany seized Kiau Chau in China
Britain responded by seizing Weihaiwei, and the next year the Russians took possession of Port Arthur
A flame of hatred for the Europeans swept through China
The Russians then seized Manchuria, and in , the British invaded Tibet
But now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great Powers, Japan
The Japanese proper are of the Mongolian race
Their civilization, their writing and their literary and artistic traditions are derived from the Chinese
For a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the Christian missionaries made a great number of converts
There were voyages in Japanesebuilt ships to India and Peru
The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and insulted the Buddhists with great acrimony
It was forbidden to build any ship larger than a mere coasting boat
No Japanese could go abroad, and no European enter the country
Meanwhile the great world outside went on to wider visions and new powers
Strange shipping became more frequent, passing the Japanese headlands sometimes ships were wrecked and sailors brought ashore
She was driven off by cannon shot
This flag presently reappeared on other ships
One in came to demand the liberation of eighteen shipwrecked American sailors
Then in came four American warships under Commodore Perry, and refused to be driven away
He landed with a guard of men to sign the treaty
Incredulous crowds watched this visitation from the outer world, marching through the streets
Russia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America
The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense
Never in all the history of mankind did a nation make such a stride as Japan then did
She completely dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some irrevocable way hopelessly behind Europe
She made all European progress seem sluggish by comparison
We cannot tell here in any detail of Japans war with China in
It demonstrated the extent of her Westernization
She had an efficient Westernized army and a small but sound fleet
Russia was pushing down through Manchuria to Korea
The three Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping any fruits from the Chinese war
She was exhausted by the struggle, and they threatened her with war
A STREET IN TOKIO A STREET IN TOKIO Japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces
They had gambled deeply in the prospective looting of Manchuria and China, and they would suffer no withdrawal
The Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on sea and land alike
The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa to be utterly destroyed in the Straits of Tshushima
The European invasion of Asia was coming to an end and the retraction of Europes tentacles was beginning
It was and is a quite unique political combination nothing of the sort has ever existed before
Helena where there was a governor GIBRALTAR GIBRALTAR Photo C
The rest of the European Powers were in a state of intensifying congestion
For thirtysix years of uneasy peace the polities of Europe centred upon that possibility
At first Great Britain stood as usual half in and half out of continental affairs
Year after year the balance of things seemed trembling towards war, and then war would be averted
At last it came
In Rumania, and in the United States and China were forced into war against Germany
Both attacks were held and turned
Then was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive activity except such as contributed to military operations
There was an enormous replacement of men by women in industry
They were socially uprooted and transplanted
The air offensive was the most revolutionary of all the new methods
It carried warfare from two dimensions into three
Hitherto in the history of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and met
Now it went on everywhere
The old distinction maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant population disappeared
The air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the war
At last great areas of Europe were in a state of siege and subject to nightly raids
Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very end of the fighting in
Famine also was staved off for some time
By the beginning of however most of Europe was in a state of mitigated and regulated famine
Business and economic life were profoundly disorganized
Everyone was worried, and most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort
The actual warfare ceased in November,
They had come to an end of their spirit and resources
At the outset of the war there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia
But the strain of the war upon this sprawling, illorganized empire was too heavy for its strength
A profound disgust for Tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men
From the close of onward Russia was a source of deepening anxiety to her Western Allies
Throughout she remained largely on the defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany
For a time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be possibleperhaps under a new Tsar
The new Russian Republic had to fight unsupported
The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war
It failed after some preliminary successes, and there came another great slaughtering of Russians
The limit of Russian endurance was reached
On March nd, , a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed at BrestLitovsk
They were fanatical Marxist communists
In July of that year an Esthonian army, under General Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg
In March, , the sailors at Cronstadt revolted
The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived all these various attacks
By the end of both Britain and Italy had made a sort of recognition of the communist rule
Hasty and illplanned attempts to make over industrial production in accordance with communist ideas were equally unsuccessful
By Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization in complete collapse
Yet the country still fought with its enemies at its gates
In came a drought and a great famine among the peasant cultivators in the wardevastated southeast provinces
Millions of people starved
It killed millions of people it wasted and impoverished the world
It smashed Russia altogether
The great war lifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered the imperialism of Russia
It cleared away a number of monarchies
From the point of view of human welfare the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate
The suggestion of a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors, was overpowering
Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great War had long been exhausted
Its chief support was in America
Now suddenly it was called upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the time
The natural disposition of the American people was towards a permanent world peace
It was a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme
In Europe however it was taken as a matured American point of view
And to their thinking he was just that great leader
In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection
The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheetanchor of safety
Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised
America dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the League Europe accepted from him
The problem would be a clearer one if the League did not yet exist
From onward the world entered upon an age of conferences
Of these the Conference at Washington called by President Harding has been the most successful and suggestive
Notable, too, is the Genoa Conference for the appearance of German and Russian delegates at its deliberations
We will not discuss this long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail
Man is still only adolescent
His troubles are not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of increasing and still undisciplined strength
As yet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of human greatness
We have dreams we have at present undisciplined but ever increasing power
